# Assessing the Human Likeness of AI-Generated Counterspeech
This repository contains the corpus of the COLING 2025 paper "Assessing the Human Likeness of AI-Generated Counterspeech".

# Data description
This dataset contains counterspeech generated by AI and written by humans. 

AI-generated counterspeech:
The AI-generated counterspeech is produced through four methods: Prompt, Prompt and Select, Finetune, and Constrained. We obtain 54,136 AI-generated counterspeech (14,799,19,436 14,215, and 5,686 respectively)

Human-written counterspeech is collected from two primary sources:

Genuine Human-Written Counterspeech:
Collected from Reddit, this subset includes authentic counterspeech organically created by platform users. The total size of this dataset is 14,973 entries.

Counterspeech from Crowd Workers:
Sourced from the Benchmark dataset (Qian et al., 2019), this component contains counterspeech written by crowd workers. A sample of 14,208 entries is included in the dataset.
