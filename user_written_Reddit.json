{"text":"Humans are not well equipped to deal with extremities. When things go extremely large or extremely small, we just don't have the reference frame to process it.\n\nHence, the concept of Hitler causing - directly or indirectly - the deaths of millions of people becomes just an abstract number. We can't really comprehend the enormity of it, except in comparison to other atrocities measured in the same order of magnitude, like the deaths caused by Stalin, Genghis Khan, or Mao (on that list, Hitler's placement depends on whether you count all the victims of WW2 in Europe as Hitler's moral responsibility, or just the ones that the Nazis actually murdered).\n\nIn other words, there's a certain level of human slaughter after which our ability to be disgusted by it becomes saturated. It's hard to disapprove the killing of a million people any more than it is to disapprove the killing of one.\n\nSo, the idea of Hitler killing his dog is something that's more immediately relatable to most people, which naturally elicits a stronger response. It's kind of like we already knew he killed this or that many people (depending on who you count as his victims), but now you learn that he also killed his dog with a cyanide capsule?

{"text":"&gt;Will this end with any real change to Biden\u2019s foreign policy? Nah. Will it start a war? Nah. Will Trump be charged with anything? Nah. But it will create threads of people saying Argh! Fuck Trumpers! Fuck Republicans! So evil. Kremlin loves Trump! He\u2019s evil! They\u2019re all evil!\n\nYou're so close. Except, it's not the big bad evil Kremlin behind it all. It's primarily a matter of the elites of *this* country spinning a narrative for their own ends. A coalition of Clintonite democratic party elites, the national security state, and media institutions like The Guardian coming together to combat both Trumpism and progressivism, and manufacture consent for the ever-expanding military industrial complex, all at the same time.\n\n[This so-called \"leak\" is likely a fabrication.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/IvanTkachev1\/status\/1415700344848494592?s=20)\n\n[Matt Taibbi has a great summary of the whole debacle on his substack.](https:\/\/taibbi.substack.com\/p\/russiagate-is-wmd-times-a-million) It's an interesting read. Here's a few choice snippets:\n\n&gt;Russiagate debuted as a media phenomenon in mid-summer, 2016. The roots of the actual story, i.e. when the multi-national investigation began, go back much further, to the previous year at least. Oddly, that origin tale has not been nailed down yet, and blue-state audiences don\u2019t seem terribly interested in it, either.\n\n&gt;By June and July of 2016, bits of the dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, which had been funded by the Democratic National Committee through the law firm Perkins Coie (which in turn hired the opposition research firm Fusion GPS), were already in the ether.\n\n&gt;The Steele report occupies the same role in #Russiagate the tales spun by Ahmed Chalabi occupied in the WMD screwup. Once again, a narrative became turbo-charged when Officials With Motives pulled the press corps by its nose to a swamp of unconfirmable private assertions.\n\n&gt;Some early stories, like a July 4, 2016 piece by Franklin Foer in Slate called \u201cPutin\u2019s Puppet,\u201d outlined future Steele themes in \u201ccircumstantial\u201d form. But the actual dossier, while it influenced a number of pre-election Trump-Russia news stories (notably one by Michael Isiskoff of Yahoo! that would be used in a FISA warrant application), didn\u2019t make it into print for a while.\n\n&gt;Though it was shopped to at least nine news organizations during the summer and fall of 2016, no one bit, for the good reason that news organizations couldn\u2019t verify its \u201crevelations.\u201d\n\n&gt;The Steele claims were explosive if true. The ex-spy reported Trump aide Carter Page had been offered fees on a big new slice of the oil giant Rosneft if he could help get sanctions against Russia lifted. He also said Trump lawyer Michael Cohen went to Prague for \u201csecret discussions with Kremlin representatives and associated operators\/hackers.\u201d\n\n&gt;Most famously, he wrote the Kremlin had kompromat of Trump \u201cderiling\u201d [sic] a bed once used by Barack and Michelle Obama by \u201cemploying a number of prostitutes to perform a 'golden showers' (urination) show.\u201d\n\n&gt;This was too good of a story not to do. By hook or crook, it had to come out. The first salvo was by David Corn of Mother Jones on October 31, 2016: \u201cA Veteran Spy Has Given the FBI Information Alleging a Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n&gt;The piece didn\u2019t have pee, Prague, or Page in it, but it did say Russian intelligence had material that could \u201cblackmail\u201d Trump. It was technically kosher to print because Corn wasn\u2019t publishing the allegations themselves, merely that the FBI had taken possession of them.\n\n&gt;A bigger pretext was needed to get the other details out. This took place just after the election, when four intelligence officials presented copies of the dossier to both President-Elect Trump and outgoing President Obama.\n\n&gt;From his own memos, we know FBI Director James Comey, ostensibly evincing concern for Trump\u2019s welfare, told the new President he was just warning him about what was out there, as possible blackmail material:\n\n&gt;&gt;I wasn\u2019t saying [the Steele report] was true, only that I wanted him to know both that it had been reported and that the reports were in many hands. I said media like CNN had them and were looking for a news hook. I said it was important that we not give them the excuse to write that the FBI has the material or [redacted] and that we were keeping it very close-hold [sic].\n\n&gt;Comey\u2019s generous warning to Trump about not providing a \u201cnews hook,\u201d along with a promise to keep it all \u201cclose-held,\u201d took place on January 6, 2017. Within four days, basically the entire Washington news media somehow knew all about this top-secret meeting and had the very hook they needed to go public. Nobody in the mainstream press thought this was weird or warranted comment.\n\n&gt;Even Donald Trump was probably smart enough to catch the hint when, of all outlets, it was CNN that first broke the story of \u201cClassified documents presented last week to Trump\u201d on January 10.\n\n&gt;At the same time, Buzzfeed made the historic decision to publish the entire Steele dossier, bringing years of pee into our lives. This move birthed the Russiagate phenomenon as a never-ending, minute-to-minute factor in American news coverage.\n\n&gt;Comey was right. We couldn\u2019t have reported this story without a \u201chook.\u201d Therefore the reports surrounding Steele technically weren\u2019t about the allegations themselves, but rather the journey of those allegations, from one set of official hands to another. Handing the report to Trump created a perfect pretext.\n\n&gt;This trick has been used before, both in Washington and on Wall Street, to publicize unconfirmed private research. A short seller might hire a consulting firm to prepare a report on a company he or she has bet against. When the report is completed, the investor then tries to get the SEC or the FBI to take possession. If they do, news leaks the company is \u201cunder investigation,\u201d the stock dives, and everyone wins.  \n\n&gt;This same trick is found in politics. A similar trajectory drove negative headlines in the scandal surrounding New Jersey\u2019s Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, who was said to be under investigation by the FBI for underage sex crimes (although some were skeptical). The initial story didn\u2019t hold up, but led to other investigations.\n\n&gt;Same with the so-called \u201cArkansas project,\u201d in which millions of Republican-friendly private research dollars produced enough noise about the Whitewater scandal to create years of headlines about the Clintons. Swiftboating was another example. Private oppo isn\u2019t inherently bad. In fact it has led to some incredible scoops, including Enron. But reporters usually know to be skeptical of private info, and figure the motives of its patrons into the story.\n\n&gt;The sequence of events in that second week of January, 2017 will now need to be heavily re-examined. We now know, from his own testimony, that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper had some kind of role in helping CNN do its report, presumably by confirming part of the story, perhaps through an intermediary or two (there is some controversy over whom exactly was contacted, and when).\n\n&gt;Why would real security officials litigate this grave matter through the media? Why were the world\u2019s most powerful investigative agencies acting like they were trying to move a stock, pushing a private, unverified report that even Buzzfeed could see had factual issues? It made no sense at the time, and makes less now.\n\n&gt;In January of 2017, Steele\u2019s pile of allegations became public, read by millions. \u201cIt is not just unconfirmed,\u201d Buzzfeed admitted. \u201cIt includes some clear errors.\u201d\n\n&gt;(...)\n\n&gt;For years, every hint the dossier might be true became a banner headline, while every time doubt was cast on Steele\u2019s revelations, the press was quiet. Washington Post reporter Greg Miller had a team looking for evidence Cohen had been in Prague. Reporters, Miller said, \u201cliterally spent weeks and months trying to run down\u201d the Cohen story.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe sent reporters through every hotel in Prague, through all over the place, just to try to figure out if he was ever there,\u201d he said, \u201cand came away empty.\u201d\n\n&gt;This was heads-I-win, tails-you-lose reporting. One assumes if Miller\u2019s crew found Cohen\u2019s name in a hotel ledger, it would have been on page 1 of the Post. The converse didn\u2019t get a mention in Miller\u2019s own paper. He only told the story during a discussion aired by C-SPAN about a new book he\u2019d published. Only The Daily Caller and a few conservative blogs picked it up.*\n\n&gt;It was the same when Bob Woodward said, \u201cI did not find [espionage or collusion]\u2026 Of course I looked for it, looked for it hard.\u201d\n\n&gt;The celebrated Watergate muckraker \u2013 who once said he\u2019d succumbed to \u201cgroupthink\u201d in the WMD episode and added, \u201cI blame myself mightily for not pushing harder\u201d \u2013 didn\u2019t push very hard here, either. News that he\u2019d tried and failed to find collusion didn\u2019t get into his own paper. It only came out when Woodward was promoting his book Fear in a discussion with conservative host Hugh Hewitt.\n\n&gt;When Michael Cohen testified before congress and denied under oath ever being in Prague, it was the same. Few commercial news outlets bothered to take note of the implications this had for their previous reports. Would a man clinging to a plea deal lie to congress on national television about this issue?"}

When telling someone to get their facts straight, make sure you have them straight yourself, and be sure to keep emotion out of your reaction in that instance.\n\n&gt;Gaza strip is not occupied since 2005, get your facts right. \n\nThere is debate around this, as Israel indeed denies occupying Gaza since the 2005 disengagement. However, Israel controls most border crossings, water supply and electricity as well as both airspace and the sea. The United Nations has clarified this as an Israeli occupation of Gaza. The UN is a less biased source here than Israel, so my claims are by no means controversial. Regardless, I notice you did not address the part about the West Bank. Maybe try to address my comment if you want to discuss the situation, rather than immediately jumping on the semantics and claiming I do not have the facts on my side, which I do \n\n&gt;Right, because Jews have no claim for this land, nor have they TOO lived ALONG the arabs in this land before? Please do your research.\n\nPlease quote me where I claimed that Jews have no claim to this land. There are clearly multiple ethnic groups who have claims to this area. I'm just saying that forced displacement of millions of people is not an ethical solution. Jewish claim to the area does not supersede other claims to the area. Nor does Palestinian claim supersede Jewish claim. You have to work with the reality there is, which is that Gaza and the West Bank are Palestinian Territory with Palestinians in them, which makes a displacement of the Palestinians completely unethical, regardless of any historical claims to the land.\n\nBut because this nuanced discussion is clearly very difficult to have for you, let me just ask you: why do you think millions of people should be deported to a foreign country, because some centuries ago their forefathers lived there? And in the same vein, do you think all non-native Americans should be deported back to the countries of their ancestors?"}

Jewish buyers who were looking for large tracts of land found it favorable to purchase from the wealthy owners.

{"text":"They can fish but are limited to distance, something enforced by Israel and Egypt. Israel as they snuggle in weapons, Egypt to protect the Suez from terrorists. Problem is that if the Palestinians do accept peace with Israel and statehood, something they have rejected 5 times, Egypt won't allow the fishing as most Palestinians in Gaza descend from the Muslim Brotherhood and Egypt exiling them into Gaza after 1948 and using it as an internment camp, just like Jordan did to Palestinians in the West Bank during Black September.\n\nThey are not being evicted from homes because they are Palestinian, they are being evicted because they are squatting. The latest dispute is due to a 50 year legal dispute over private land ownership. The buildings in question in 1948 were legally owned by a Jewish family. When Jordan illegally occupied East Jerusalem, squatters moved in and have been there ever since. Had they have paid rent them they would never have been evicted as there are sitting tenant rights.\n\nThe land was not taken from people and landed ownership was upheld. Any Palestinian that was kicked out of their homes by Jewish Militia all accepted financial compensation. The problem was that the Arabs (the term Palestinian came about in 1967), didn't own land as they were mostly nomadic, as confirmed by a survey by T.E. Laurence who confirmed that most people opening homes and living there were Jews, the larger amount of Arabs were Bedouins just passing through. Israel then.

I'm sure the journalists without a job there noe will be fine.\n\nThere was no reported casualties from the strike, and you know very well that if there were it would be spread on every news network. The building was evacuated more than an hour before it was destroyed, so it's certainly a reasonable assumption to say that there were no deaths as a result.\n\n&gt;2. I've seen zero proof that that bombing was housing anything other than the media, leading me to believe Israel just blew up a news publication because it was critical of them.\n\nFirst off, I haven't heard any news publication make the claim you're making - i.e. that the building was only housing media. So I'm not sure where you're getting this from. \n\nEither way, even if there was evidence that Hamas used this building, I wouldn't expect them to release such evidence in the middle of an operation. So you can assume all you want, but considering that (a) Hamas has consistently used schools, public buildings and even hospitals (e.g. Shifa hospital, under which Hamas' headquarters are located) as offices, weapon caches, missile launching sites, etc., and (b) Israel is under tremendous international scrutiny and will look terrible during the inevitable ICC investigation (or equivalent) if it can't produce evidence demonstrating the building was used by Hamas -- I don't find it an unreasonable thing at all. So I guess we'll just have to wait and see.\n\n&gt;3. Never said that Hamas also wasn't evil, good job on the strawman though.\n\nNot really a strawman. Typically when people say that one side are \"the bad guys\", it implies that the other side are the good guys - or at least relatively better. Perhaps you didn't mean it in that way, and in that case I take it back, but it's not a strawman as it's a reasonable interpretation of your statement and unintentional. \n\n&gt;4. Israel and the IDP's anti-free speech and anti-Palestinian behavior is worrying. I've seen zero justification for the mosque attack led by Israeli defense forces earlier this week, or for the settlement on Palestinian occupied land, OR for the treatment of the Palestinian journalist Muhammad El-Kurd.\n\nDo you mean IDF? The IDF didn't participate in the \"mosque attack\", the Israeli police did. And they certainly had some justification for it considering that the people on the temple mount were stockpiling rocks in and around al-aqsa \/ the temple mount to throw on innocent people praying at the western wall, and at the police. When groups of rioters endanger peoples' life by throwing rocks, molotov cocktails and shooting fireworks at innocent people and police officers, it's the police's job to disperse \/ quell that riot -- which is exactly what they did."}

The Romans eventually affected the middle east in ways that negatively affected and weakened the Israelis great army. The Persians and others helped Israel rebuild Jerusalem as well. Anyway the takeaway is tgat the Palestinians have no claim over these areas they lie, and Israel has every right to revendicate these lands and it is furthermore a know fact that where the Muslim temple mount dome is located in Jerusalem was purposefully built there to cover the truth, there are extremely significant Jewish artifacts that are buried under that Muslim temple mosque. \nIn any case Israel has every right to these lands and the responsible people for the whole conflict is and always has been HAMAS that has no desire for peace, needs conflict to justify its existence, has used its civilians as a shield and as camouflage for bombs and weapons, as for the Al Jazeera building Hamas was using the communications assets to organize terrorist attacks.\nIsrael has always wanted peace and many peace talks have failed because Hamas's bad faith and never was interested in peace.

According the JGOD it's never been touched in any way and has just been forgotten about with all the Cold War weapons. I'm actually beating FFARs 1 on 1 with it now, which has been impossible before the ADS nerf. \n\nAt this point I'll only use the M16 because I actually like the occasional burst rifle, but I'm running primarily MP5\/SP-R and starting to have fun again, finally. AMAX\/M16 has been my other setup lately.\n\nCan't wait for another month of hell coming up with the new map."}

What new and great way to go get people to your next product is to advertise it like crazy on the previous, which people seemed to have enjoyed.\n\nA great way to not see it at all is to simply not play the game or uninstall it, but most people can\u2019t resist not playing for too long or at all."}

Based on two weeks performance, he agreed to pay me full time, 40 hours, a week as long as I completed at least a week's worth of work. \n\nSo then I turned in a little more ahead-of-schedule work, and then was able to work like 16ish hours a week for a full paycheck.

Is it the novelty?\n\nIt's sloppily made without attention to detail, and made out of two primary colors that don't go well together at all.\n\nI've unlocked it and the only weapon I use it on is the kali sticks because it's black with some blue stripes, and none of the red shit."}
{"text":"It\u2019s not even broken. It was murdered. \n\nI got a ps5 and had CW installed and can\u2019t have both installed because of space. \n\nReinstall MW and play come to find out I can no longer edit my class in game. \n\nGoes to google. \n\nReason given: was creating a bug in warzone so they just removed it completely. \n\nIt\u2019s such bullshit. Everyone knows this is just a way to keep people buying things. I knew activision could be shady but to completely ruin and take out base things in a game two years later is insane to me and is precedent setting. \n\nNo longer is the game you buy always the game you\u2019re promised. Two years later that game can be a completely different thing with none of the original features. \n\nTLDR ended up uninstalling MW immediately after redownloading."}

{"text":"lol\n\nYou melted the fuck down and read through his comments because he called it woke. You need to get a grip yourself."}
{"text":"Yes it is woke. Because WW2 is already extremely interesting the way it is. There\u2019s no need to embellish it at all or add things that don\u2019t belong. But the devs do it anyway because the modern woke crowd of children and young adults cannot handle actual history. They don\u2019t find it cool enough."}

The only explanation was \"I didn't buy 4 in 1\" which was, umm, wow. \n\nBtw, want a list with other games that have the same menus? I feel that if you see one more menu like that you will loose it, man. Need to protect you from big bad menus now."}

{"text":"&gt; There's nothing to be against.\n\nExactly. So why do you think there's so much rabid pushback against the bill?\n\nDo you think it's because most people have misread it? Is it liberal bias because the author is more conservative than them?\n\nWhy are people dumping so hard on a bill designed to protect individual rights? At worst, it will do nothing - and at best - it will provide additional protections for individuals and force additional transparency on large corporations."}
{"text":"So far you've been a bit dense, so a bit of clarity would help quite a bit to let others understand what you're trying to prove.\n\nYou appear to be arguing that both censorship and lack of transparency aren't problems that exist; which I find truly amusing. Luckily, asshole opinions and lies are allowed - despite what you wrote in this thread - and additional protections to guarantee your right to say them is a worthy pursuit. Having bills and laws in place that strengthen these rights should be praised."}

{"text":"I'm actually AK'd up on the server I'm playing on right now.  Youre making dogshit assumptions.  If you read even half of what I said with an open mind, you'd understand why those assumptions are so asinine.  I have 500 hours on rust and it's pretty easy with a brain half equipped for human decency to see that you can play and enjoy the game by raiding, stealing, getting raided, and dying without being a moronic trashbag.  The problem is the community feeding off each other's toxicity and thereby justifying their own toxicity, making them go numb and braindead to what is acceptable behavior and what isn't.  Just because I raided\/killed you doesnt justify you insulting me as a human, just as  you raiding\/killing me doesnt justify it either.  It's a game, and it's incredible how this extremely simple, easy to follow concept is lost on 90% of the community because they're too braindead to deviate from the standard mindset (monkey see, monkey do I guess).   The things that happen to you in a video game dont translate to things people are doing to you personally.  It's a virtual world, it's not real and it doesnt exist.  No one should be degrading other people as human beings for shit that happens in a video game.  That is so low IQ that it blows my mind that so many people stand behind that mindset just because every other braindead rust player does.  There's a niche of good players that will never default to the same dogshit mentality that involves justifying degrading other people, and that proves the game is not the problem and therefore it is not inherently toxic.  It's the sheep people that justify being a trash human being to other humans because of shit happening in a fucking video game that are the problem.  The ones that do it because \"every one else does it\" thar are feeding the issue, and therefore are the issue.  If I lose my base, I join a different server because it's not fucking real.  Either that or I do something else because I have an entire real life of things to do.  Other video games to play even.  You can not, with an IQ above 80, legitimately justify to yourself that toxicity is an okay thing ever.  I assume your IQ is higher than that, so go prove it by deviating from the norm and being nice in Rust.  Raid their base, take their shit, and wish them a nice day.  It's actually super simple and rewarding.   It's really stupid to default to toxicity simply because thats what every one else is doing when it's really fuckimg simple to just not do that.  \n\nAlso, just to clarify, I do get frustrated and upset at the game.  I'm not an emotional savant, but it takes a simple decision to decide not to be a trash human to whoever just beat you.  Dont say or type some deplorable shit, and it is really that simple.  If you complete this one simple feat, congratulations, youre not a trash human like nearly every one else playing the game regularly.  Pretty easy right?  If you cant make that simple decision, then you're just lost on what it means to be a decent human, and it has nothing to do with the game itself.  At the very least, you have to accept that."}

E. Feminism cannot exist without them). \n\nDo you know the origin of feminism and what was its original definition? Have you ever considered that feminism was always a grifter movement, having only the goal of supremacy in mind. A great example of this is Simone de Beauvoir's work, who came up with the feminist term \"patriarchy\" as a way to justify being in an abusive relationship (she was both abusive and abused) projecting her life as if it was the norm, rather than an exception. Or was jailing men for not paying the taxes for their wife's business fair (spoiler wife's not owning property was a way of simplifying the tax system)?\n\nI have a long comment with citations I can link.

What I'm blaming (criticising would be the better word) for is the abandonment of his children.\n\nThere are two different crimes having occured here. The first is the crime of paternity fraud, which I'm not blaming the father for. The second is the crime of child abandonment, which I am blaming the father for.\n\nFor women who fall pregnant due to rape and decide to abort, well, that is an entirely different matter that I have a **very** controversial opinion on. It isn't relevant to the discussion at hand, so I won't bring it up.\n\nOh, and I certainly can judge people for their actions in situations that I haven't been involved in. What an inane proposition to put forward. Just as stupid as the people who argue that men can't have a say in any discussion of abortion because they aren't women. Stupid.\n\nThe thing is this mate, no one is blaming the father for having been deceived. What they are being blamed for is child abandonment. Nothing I've said is designed to shame men into continuing with the status quo. The man should leave their wife, cut off all contact and try their damnedest to attain full custody - because obviously the wench isn't a fit parent.\n\nYou need to take a step back, take a deep breath, and look at this from a position outside of emotion.

They all do it. A lot. One major reason is because while not *all* feminist theory and doctrine is outright hateful, (although plenty is) just about ALL feminist ideas facilitate the patterns of thought that LEAD to hate. For example: We live in a patriarchy - men are privileged - women are disadvantaged relative to men at best, subjugated and oppressed at worst - Men facilitate and control this system - men are my oppressors. Hatred or at least distaste of men is *the logical conclusion to this train of thought*. Looking at it objectively, how could you not begin to hate someone who is oppressing you?

{"text":"Sure. I never disagreed with that.\n\nMy point actually was geared towards the complete lack of regard men have when it comes to hate against women despite wanting male victims to be taken seriously. \n\nAlso, I think there are contextual aspects to some sayings that influence how we feel about sayings.\n\nFor example, since I\u2019m black, I see a lot of controversy about the \u201cN-word\u201d.\n\nSince black people were victims in the past, the N-word has little consequence for us using it in modern times. But for white people, it can be cause for expulsion, being fired, etc.\n\nApplying this CONCEPT (not bringing race into the subject but the CONCEPT OF CONTEXT), women were victimized SEVERELY in the past in terms of sexual assault, rape, rights, violence, etc. KillAllMen has less of an impact when women say it as opposed to men saying \u201cKillAllWomen\u201d.\n\nAlso, with modern day \u201crevenge porn\u201d, \u201crevenge killings\u201d, covered-up rape-homicides of female military officers, extent of female sex-trafficking, abuse of female porn stars, abuse of female employees, government officials and their EXTENSIVE abuse of underage girls, \u201chappy ending spas\u201d, presidents and their blatant disregard for women including multiple sexual assault allegations, etc.\n\nThere\u2019s still an extensive amount of blatant, violent, physical sexism against women.

Trump spent $85,000 placing full page ads in the four daily New York City newspapers calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty. Subsequently known as the Central Park Five, they were all indicted and convicted, but their convictions were overturned in 2002 when a serial rapist confessed to the crimes.

But you could genuinely argue that women uphold more power in society than men. While feminism is a multi-billion dollar movement, that has the power to influence laws, sway money away from male shelters and male programs. the MRM is barely making ground, and can't even get the \"hate-movement\" label dropped.

Calling it indentured servitude is an attempt to create a victim narritive because you have to provide for your children."}
{"text":"Do you think men should have a choice in whether or bot women get an abortion? Let me rephrase, do you think men should be able to override a womans decision on whether she wants to carry to term? No, you don't. Or at least you know it's bigoted and you wont say it.\n\nSo you came to the conclusion that \"if i don't get to decide what happens to a woman because she has a fetus that is argueably partially mine, i sure as hell am not gonna pay for it\" in your head that works, its common sense, it feels like an equivalency. But its not, its a face value similarity. This is due to two main reasons. #1: you do not nessacarily have the right to money the way she has reproductive rights. For example the gocernment can tax someone, but it cannot force them to abort a pregnancy. #2: now that the baby exists, it is yours. You have equal rights to it whether you want it or not and, you owe it whether you want it or not. Same goes for her. \n\nTo \"fix\" this would be to make child support optional. Create a legal system where women are financially tied  to children and men are not. One where men have the choice between giving their child the life it deserves and personal monetary gain. That is bad for women and even more so for children."}

There are two main ways men get fucked over when it comes to them. They can't force the women to abort\/keep and they also can't relinquish their parental rights if she decides to keep. I do not think another person should have the right to force someone to do something against their will. So the easiest and most ethical change would just be to let men have the right the relinquish their parental rights if done before the child is born. THIS is the change that would lead to equality. This bill is a half-assed attempt at the first one, that is only barely legal because of how it subverts the whole point of the Roe v Wade."}

{"text":"Yeah it pisses me off too that they want to remove merit based hiring and hire strictly to get more menstruating people and people of color in for what some virtue signaling fuck all benefit? I witnessed this in real life with two anecdotes, my buddy was trying to get a job with the state of MI an office job, they strung him along for like a year or more anticipating an interview, he studies and prepared all the things he needed to know. So he gets there and they start blabbering on and on about diversity and asking him these left field questions about diversity and he\u2019s like Wtf, I studied all the content for the position and didn\u2019t prepare to answer these questions. So it turns out this unit in the state hires almost strictly women and wants more people of color there. Absolutely asinine. \n\nMy other friend had a sister who was also trying to get a job with the state in corrections and her whole family is in corrections she was perfectly qualified and they were ready to hire her, but they gave the position to a black woman because that\u2019s what they wanted. Hiring on the basis of someone\u2019s demographic, is that not discriminating? After a month or two she utterly bombed at her job she was gone and they gave it to my friends sister immediately thereafter. She had to overcome the hurdle of virtue signaling diversity. \n\nIn reality sorry to say it but diversity isn\u2019t a strength, diversity sounds like division. Unity is a strength and there\u2019s studies to show a more homogenous workforce works better together, better group cohesion and productivity. You\u2019re never allowed to say that though. I\u2019m not a racist or whatever i\u2019m just a realist, I look at things objectively. You cannot artificially thrust people into positions because it makes you look good and you feel guilty that you\u2019re all white or whatever. Companies and organizations should only hire the most qualified individuals. I don\u2019t want to put my faith into something that could be a sub par product. \n\nThis girl who was on fresh and fit tried to become a plumber, she went to the schooling and there was tons of affirmative action to fast track her in, they were excited to have a woman and she got the job over more qualified men and she got paid more than more experienced men who\u2019d actually been doing the job! Not long into it shes realizing that she can\u2019t physically perform the job, she couldn\u2019t tighten the nuts or carry the pipes whatever it was she couldn\u2019t physically do it so she dropped out. So they put in all this effort to put women into male fields higher paying fields etc. and that\u2019s not even what the women want to do and are they even qualified to do it ? \n\nWe shouldn\u2019t sacrifice having a meritocratic rule set, because those are the rules men live by and always have, we have a burden of performance, but you can\u2019t give women or any so called \u201cprotected groups\u201d a different rule set and undue privilege. Weak beta men who pander to this are a danger to society. The allies and betas are the type of pussies to put everyone in danger. If we let women run shit then society will run itself into the ground, left to their own devices women often are set to self destruct, it\u2019s just the way they operate being emotional thinkers. We need men to keep things grounded in reality, masculine men who have the balls to say no to shit they deem is wrong. \n\nWeak men pandering to the female imperative is called sneaky fucker game, where you join her side and basically cuck yourself and become her girlfriend in hopes to one day get sex. These cucks can put everyone in danger and gets into a whole discussion on if women should be allowed in policing or military in frontline combat positions, women can certainly be a liability in these positions. A black man overpowered and beat a female cop to death, took her gun then murdered 3-4 innocent people, the likelihood of this happening had this been a male cop would be greatly reduced. Women\u2019s only option is gun or taser and it\u2019s a liability. 3 Swedish feminist cops couldn\u2019t subdue one singular average build man, they backed away in fear and it took another average build male citizen to come out of the woodwork and took the guy down rather swiftly and subdued him better than those three women ever could of. Point is we can\u2019t pander to emotional ideas and let women run shit. It\u2019s not about hatred it\u2019s just an obligation to objective truth."}

{"text":"It's not ridiculous at all: contracts exist to obtain a win-win outcome which is beneficial to society and breaking contracts without penalty would soon lead to anarchy.\n\nThe marriage \"contract\" has been implemented in a similar way for many millennia. It enabled a balance between what a man wanted and what a woman wanted: effectively resources and protection (for child rearing) in exchange for ready access to sex. Seems like a reasonable trade to me, especially if sex is supposed to be pleasurable for both.\n\nVarying the contract is also reasonable, as long as the win-win balance remains. If women want to choose if they have sex, then the man must receive an equivalent benefit in choosing if to provide resources or alternatively, freedom to choose to obtain surplus sexual needs outside the marriage.\n\nSadly, society has not debated what is reasonable and fair, but simply decided to unilaterally vary the contract in favour of women. This would never be tolerated in commerce because of its consequences to stability, yet we don't bat an eye when it is done within human society, which is arguably much more important.\n\nI would even be in favour of tearing up the contract and starting again from a clean slate with equal rights that are non-gendered, but not this insidious contract alteration which is already destabilising society."}

That IS the basis that makes the most sense behind the asymmetry we see between the handling of the different genders in different arenas. \n\nIf I say \u201cSo and so murdered their child because they were mad their partner cheated\u201d does that mean I support murder?

I'm not an MRA, but I am anti-feminists (most women are as well), so I come here for ideas sometimes and have made videos that MRA would agree with.  Thus, I guess there is some crossover since MRAs are most undoubtedly anti-feminist.  But even if I think that way about MRAs, MGTOW, Bluepillers (more cucks than incels), that doesn't mean every single one of them.  There are a lot of people on these subs.  You can look at subs overall behaviour and the things posted there and extrapolate based on the characterizations of self-proclaimed incels and compare.  So, whether they are actually an incel or act like an incel doesn't make much difference to me.    \n\n\nHowever, MGTOW, specifically, is incel because there are not that many men willingly saying no to an attractive woman making sexual advances.  And those that still \"see\" women or whatnot aren't MGTOW unless it's purely a business transaction.  They all make themselves sound like the Nice car, nice job, nice style, good looking gay guys (for imagery) down the street when in reality, they're the police tape wearing, pizza-faced nerds in their parents' basement."}

Moreover, right now is the popular time to bash on men. It gets them more clicks and views and support even from outside organizations because it's the popular topic.\n\nDo not be surprised if and when Reddit flips around and takes a different approach on issues based on new social and political climates.\n\n**They're a business.** Everyone seems to forget that. They're trying to get to IPO so that they can cash out. Of course they'll cut out minority communities in favor of bringing more users on. They've already thrown out and progressively pushed away their old user base that got them to this point.\n\nDon't take it personally, it's business as usual. If someone is smart, they'll create a new platform that can progressively replace Reddit, and I don't mean any of those garbage heaps that spawned off of people leaving Reddit, there's a reason why those aren't successful.\n\n**Edit:** there's a reason why when an adult woman and a minor male get intimate it's called that while an adult male and minor female doing so is called rape. It's because our society thrives on double standards AND because women's issues have been pursued for almost a century now. We men need to fight for our issues and rights and equality (sorry ladies, but if you don't understand how men don't have equality you need to do some homework. You cherry pick the most affluent and successful to judge us all by, leaving the majority to be the ones who get screwed. That's not misogyny, that's not Patriarchy, that's how it is. I'm grateful for subs like r\/MenKamf because it's a smart way to call out the misandry when doing so forwardly would get backlash. We just want equality, equity, and love for all. Why is this so hard?)\n\nEdit 2: PPS: ladies, and any misguided person, helping men's rights doesn't mean not helping women's rights. In fact, the more we help each other out the sooner we can create  better world for everyone. Being an extremist, gaslighting, or denying does no one help and it really hurts everyone in the long run. Por que no los dos?"}

When you get time please read the above articles. If you are quoting articles never ever use Google use 'Google scholar'. It will help you to get better results that are peer-reviewed.\n\nThrowing things when someone is down isn't a masculine trait or even humanly that's cowardly. Please read your comments without prejudice as if it was written by a different person and let me know your thoughts. \n\nAlso, read the articles and the curriculum that is for clinical psychologist. It's feminine. \n\nKindly do a favor for yourself. Educate with appropriate Resources. Don't go to feminist forum and get info. It's a legalized man hating sub! \n\nBTW, I am a women!\n\nEdit : addressing 85% clinical psychologist info. \nYes, based on the articles it's 65% women with a steady rise at 8% per year and men have remained stable since 2007. So, being picky to argue is not good. Please please read and comprehend! \n\nDeath of men after seeking help is shameful and people like you who are out there having fun at it is disgusting! Hoping that your parents are proud of you!"}

Well, read again and again - which part of my comments blamed women it blamed feminists! \n\nLet me know when you are ready to read and comprehend things then we can have a civil discussion.\n\nRegarding the comment hoping that my kids grow with a better mentor - I have chosen a boyfriend who knows when he is wrong and constantly trying to better himself.

If MRA are toxic or not, we can always debate, as there are many MRA organisations and there is no unified theory as in the feminist case. There is also no theoretical attempt to change any aspect of society, and definitely no academic brainwashing courses on how to engender everything and make it bend to men's demands.\n\nAnd I would like to correct the first part of your sentence: **most feminists** think MRA are toxic. They also say that anyone who doesnt bow to their stupid demands is an incel anyway. But no rational person would say such things."}

{"text":"Those in charge of what exactly? Sorry the first part of your comment I'm missing the context on.\n\nSocial aspect is part of it, but the men who are already retreating from society are less concerned with that, and that is a growing demographic as a result of the war SJWs and feminists have waged in men for decades. And yes you can watch porn, but they still have a biological impulse for sex, not just getting off, so if they could have that without the social requirements that come with it currently? If it was legal and normalized to be able to go to a brothel, then absolutely I think that would further increase the demographic of men backing away from traditional relationships. I see this as a win for men and women honestly."}

Not that it happens all the time, but normalizing moral depraved behaviors lead to a repetitive cycle in which their next morally depraved action is justified in their minds.\n\nPsychology 101.

Gave us worse grades, hit us in the knuckles with rulers, told me at 8 years I was worthless. \n\nOne of the worst offenders was a woman who was close to our family and tutored me in her part time. She would tell me to strip and then took pictures of me. I told my dad about this in 2004, he believed me, he hired 5 guys to go to her house and beat the living daylights out of her and her husband. She later confessed to the cops that she sexually abused many kids. One of the kids she abused was the son of a politician, he made sure she left the state and revoked her teaching license. \n\nSo yes, I\u2019ve had direct experience with the cunty women of your country.

{"text":"Oh I believe that is the ultimate end goal of feminism. However, that\u2019s as practical solution based in reality as women accepting responsibility for their own actions at the point. They can want men as slaves all they want, and even to a very self-hating minority of white knights, they will succeed. However, the vast majority of men with even a shred of dignity left in them will not become one. \n\nSociety thinks the divorce rate is high today and less men are getting married than ever before, just wait until that scenario becomes reality.\n\nEdit: thought of another point here. What pray tell are the self appointed female leaders going to do when it comes to negotiations with other societies who see women as truly second class non-entities, such as the more medieval non-progressive climates? I won\u2019t mention any specific ones here, but we all know to whom I\u2019m referring to here. How are you going to convince them that women are superior and should be taken seriously? Military force you say?

Who are the people who usually call men simps? It's usually other men, I'm sure women do it to, but those women aren't usually feminists nor are they the majority of women. Where are you getting these facts from. Most women don't care if people hold the door for them. Some do, but feminists are the ones who hate chivalry, remember? I've never seen a woman go crazy because someone didn't hold a door for her. The most I've seen was an old lady scoff at my mom for not holding the door for her, but she didn't go crazy. You're generalizing, you're doing to women the same thing you accuse feminists of doing to men. There are a lot of men who hate being disrespected by women and will go crazy on them, there are domestic abusers who are men, men will not always let it go. Many women including myself have been stalked and harrassed by men for rejecting them. Also men should not be praised for not freaking out when they are rejected, that's a normal human thing. False rape allegations are rare and real rape allegations almost never win in court. You are fighting women that don't really exist. You obviously have a lot of hate towards women and no stakes for your claim. The court system favors rapists and you are not being productive you are just like the feminists you're describing. I've never called a sexist man a pig because it is dehumanizing. You've fallen down an antifemist rabbit whole. Where have you heard about all these feminists who call men simps, get mad when the door isn't held for them, and accuse men of rape when rejected? What world do you live in? You must not interact with a lot of women because all your talking points are the unverified \"Psycho Bitch\" stereotype. I was just like you until I watched Hbomberguy. You accuse women of treating men how you treat feminists and you have a biased view of the world. You obviously haven't listened to a real feminist in your life just men's rights where they do nothing for men and hate women. If you really cared about men you would be on a productive sub like men's lib. But instead you are on this one. Edit: just check your post history. You hate women, but you don't really care about men you're literally a conservative and against BLM which is an organization against the police brutality that kills so many men. All your comments are just blaming women for everything but you never have any solutions for men. You blame women for all men's problems when it's not true and only support make survivors to dunk on female ones. You are disgusting and disingenuous."}

{"text":"I think this entire explanation is a great way to start the conversation, though I also think it is ESSENTIAL to remove individual blame from the equation. It shouldn\u2019t be a case of men vs. women, as they are both raised by and suffering within a patriarchal society. People of all genders have internalized the misogyny that has existed in our society since it\u2019s beginning, and all are capable of perpetuating that. Same with the rest of the -isms. I think it would be more effective and conducive to a productive conversation to consider the effects of the patriarchy not as a byproduct of misogyny, but as byproducts of the unequal power and privilege allotted to one social group- in the case of America, white, cis men. Misandry is not innocent, though I do think it\u2019s equally as under stable as anyone being sexist in a society that teaches and perpetuates sexism.  \n\nI have run into many feminist circles where the popular belief is that women deserve the position of men because of the historical oppression against their group. Personally, I think this is little more than an unhealed, right wing response to their own societal experiences. The only true way to revert to equality, between all social groups, is to dismantle the entire society that was born under a racist patriarchy and to consider all marginalized groups as one in rebuilding it. \n\nA direction does not exist without an opposite and equal move. By this I mean, the effects felt by women, queer and ethnic communities subsequently impact the group in power of those effects. The inequality is a cyclical system that, by design, perpetuates discrimination between groups to avert their attention from the root cause: not misogyny, or misandry, or racism, but historically the ethnocentrism of the patriarchy we come from."}

Lead a movement, fuck kids, blame dead men and kids for it, it's all good your side won't hold you accountable until maybe later when it doesn't matter.

{"text":"Feminism, the word, was originally coined by early men's rights activists\/ anti-suffragists to describe pro-female beliefs and behaviors that are irritating or possibly even harmful to men.

And if it really is valid, then over time most other people will stop using a word intended as an insult to describe that belief.\n\nBut if you wish to take an insult word, redefine it to mean something positive, then self-identify with it to the extent that you consider people still using it as an insult to be bigots even if they are making a valid point.\n\nWell, then you really are a feminist."}

This statement claims that literally 100% of all feminists on the planet don\u2019t support statutory(sp?) rape. I think this is what I have a problem with since all it takes is one to not fit this and now your statement is inaccurate. If you had said \u201cno proper feminist\u201d or something, I\u2019d agree with you. But considering the blanket statement you gave, and the fact that Radical Feminism is a very sizable percentage (arguably the vast majority these days) of feminism as a whole, and Radical Feminists have long-since left the bounds of reality, I find your original statement all the more unlikely.\n\nWhat the original commenter was addressing is the tendency of some feminists to not condemn the actions of any women simply because they are women and no matter what they\u2019ve done. This is an observable fact and happens fairly frequently, though I will admit that it does not appear to be more than a small minority of feminists as a whole. This is what I personally have observed, mostly on twitter but not exclusively, which is why I responded the way I did.\n\nSorry for the small novel here but I hope this clears some things up."}

To become disenfranchised because there is nothing but shit to choose from?    I don't think the Christian God wants them to sit it out.  You have to effect change where you can.  And there have been immoral men that have done much good in the world.   The disciples Paul and even Judas, for example.\n\nThere is no expectation of perfection, nor of Christians judging others.   Most leave that up to ya'll libs.\n\nDId I identify as Christian.   Don't remember doing so."}
{"text":"I really appreciate the thorough response here. You make a lot of great points.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest here Biden was far from my first choice. I will call him out when he makes mistakes. The military budget hes proposed is INSANE. In a three way race between Trump, Biden and any other Democrat nominee I would likely pick the other.\n\nThe Russiagate thing has definitely turned into a cop out. Tara Reade definitely isn\u2019t a Russian asset, I was simply explaining why people brought it up. Today\u2019s news is definitely shocking though and really does solidify the idea that there was collusion between the Trump Campaign and Russia. Whether or not is a conspiracy... yeah it\u2019s debatable. But yes it is tiring when people use it as a blanket cop out.\n\nHis age is concerning. Again I would have preferred almost anybody else. In his speeches as president he is definitely much more articulate. When it\u2019s off the cuff or in more of a back and forth conversation, or he\u2019s being interrupted he\u2019s much less polished.\n\nEither way it\u2019s not about teams.

{"text":"I am from Mexico, ivermectin was used here, the IMSS did a analysis study on our capital and several states and a recollection of the studies of other countries as well, the evidence was so clear that it is recommended here.

The only \r\nuncertainty in the evidence relates to the precise extent of the reduction, not in the \r\neffectiveness of ivermectin itself. Similarly, when ivermectin is used as prophylaxis among \r\nhealth care workers and contacts, it is clear that ivermectin substantially reduces COVID-19 \r\ninfections, probably somewhere in the region of 88% (82% to 92%). Data from numerous \r\ncurrently active RCTs will help to determine the precise extent of its protective effect in \r\nthese at risk groups.\r\nDespite the FLCCC\u2019s strong recommendation that ivermectin should be implemented \r\nglobally to save lives from COVID-19, most governments and health professionals still \r\nappear to be unaware of this profoundly effective COVID-19 treatment. Not only is \r\nivermectin a safe, effective and well-known medicine, at an estimated cost of less than 10 \r\npence per person treated with a 12 mg tablet, it does indeed seem like a miracle drug in the \r\ncontext of the current global COVID-19 situation.\"\n\n[Study 2 (spanish)](https:\/\/covid19.cdmx.gob.mx\/storage\/app\/media\/Articulos\/revision-de-ivermectina-corregida13ene20.pdf)\n\nTranslated conclusion (collective meta analysis of several countries and studies):\n\n\"Weighing the risk-benefit of early stage ivermectin that can benefit and avoid complications at moderate and severe stages in the absence of a proven treatment, the usefulness of this compassionate use drug becomes relevant. Comparatively Ivermectin vs. other therapies with controversial effects and that require hospital management, it is a drug very noble, inexpensive, safe and that is still being studied for its inhibitory effects on proteins viral infections, showing increasingly better results in clinical practice and in included studies and commented on in this review.\"\n\n\n\n[Evidence 3 (spanish)](https:\/\/www.forbes.com.mx\/imss-cdmx-ivermectina-reduce-riesgo-hospitalizacion-covid-19\/)\n\nTranslated conclusions:\n\n\"The Secretary of Health of the capital government, Oliva L\u00f3pez Arellano, pointed out that there were no serious reactions to ivermectin, which until before the pandemic had been used in Mexico to attack cases of the parasitic disease of onchocerciasis. \u201cSince last year there was in vitro evidence that (ivermectin) had an antiretroviral effect, with very few side effects. After many studies by European groups, in North and South America, it was decided together with the IMSS to do it on a massive scale and what we have is a reducing effect of the serious Covid-19 event \u201d, she commented.\"\n\n[Study 4](https:\/\/www.salud.cdmx.gob.mx\/conoce-mas\/covid-19\/ivermectina-y-hospitalizacion-por-covid-19):\n\n\"We found a significant reduction in hospitalizations among patients who received the ivermectin-based medical kit; the range of the effect is 52%- 76% depending on model specification. Conclusions The study supports ivermectin-based interventions to assuage the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health system.\""}

I don\u2019t get how someone saying things like \u201cpeacefully and patriotically\u201d \u201crespect law and order\u201d etc... is inciting but when democrats were yelling at that stuff we never said shit, we cheered for it while chanting \u201cdefund the police\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re quite literally straw manning me while attempting to project your own liberal problems. It\u2019s not a whataboutism, it\u2019s simply opening ones eyes to the hypocrisy that is American politics. Liberals can call for the dismantling of the government and defunding of the police, but trump tells people to protest and stand up for what they believe in and it\u2019s the end of the world. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI don\u2019t understand how people think that after labeling trump supporters are red neck, racist, NRA loving, gun toting hillbillies. That all have been saving their guns for years, and you think they\u2019re big coup de grace, was John Sullivan (you should research him) pushing people and breaking in, attempting to incite violence, while people walk around in trump hats taking selfies. Funny how \u201cwe know they\u2019re trump supporters, they were wearing MAGA hats, and waved a trump flag\u201d yes because no one else in the world can get a hold of those things, you need to actually join the trump cult and give blood to their overlord in order to branish a hat and shirt."}

I didn't want to get stuck in my boring hometown. My first duty station, I dealt with, what at the time I thought was toxic leadership. Most of my NCO's were black and i didn't like that they were hard on me. So that really hardened my stance on what I had said for years. Then I got sent on a different mission with a different group of guys, with what I thought was a better mission. And that's where I saw true loyalty to one another. Color didn't matter. Religion didn't matter. Sexual preference didn't matter. The hardships my unit endured in Iraq, and the love I saw and felt from all of my brothers changed my views on race. I learn the blood of everyone, regardless of skin color, looks the same when it's smeared across the inside of a humvee or spilled in some shitty fucking building,, or anywhere else there. \n\nSorry for the long post, but I guess I just had to write all that out. \n\nTldr: Was racist piece of shit.

Then I\u2019d say they were deliberately and willfully excluding other victims based on race.\n\nAgain the OP chose not to post this story from a regular source and they also chose not to include other victims but by associating this story with a suspended BLM twitter account they were deliberately drawing attention to race. \n\nMaybe you\u2019re  really naive and don\u2019t understand this, I dunno but you\u2019re going to have to ask why OP chose a suspended BLM twitter account and why they didn\u2019t just link to an MSM story on this case..because yeah it would be a lot easier to link to an MSM story than to find a post from a suspended twitter account."}

That real estate has consistently gone up in value for at least the last century. Partially because of real growth, partially because of inflation. \n\nWhat rich land owners like Trump do, is borrow money against their property. If the property continues rising in value faster than the interest rate on the loan, you can keep doing that FOREVER, because you keep gaining equity. We don't know what Trump's actual net worth is, because we don't know exactly how much in assets and debt he has. \n\nThis works fantastic, until your property stops growing faster than interest rates. Then suddenly, you might owe more in debt than you're capable of paying back or refinancing away. If that happens then you legitimately get liquidated and lose everything. \n\nWe know that Trump has been in negative net worth territory in the past, and he's always managed to pull himself out from the brink. But of course we don't know exactly how he did that, or exactly who he borrowed money from. \n\nBut to say that he can't be bought is ludicrous. We have no idea exactly what kind of financial position Trump is in because he's refused to disclose that information. \n\nMaybe we need to legally require significant financial disclosure of anyone who chooses to run for political office.

Just because you haven't moved on from the Russiagate news cycle doesn't mean China isn't up to anything nefarious you ignorant neanderthal of a human being.  If you think communist China doesn't have a hold on their citizens or international business then think again. Look how easy it was for the #FreeHongKong protests and the worldwide anguish it caused to become obsolete once we all started worrying about a pandemic (from China nonetheless). I'm not one to dwell on conspiracies but it seems awfully coincidental how easily china gets swept under the rug in the US news cycle for the vodka-drinking, Trump-humping Russians right?!?!?! Libs wanna scream Russiagate and BLM but wont acknowledge the newly elected President has all but ignored these cries. Biden sucks off China like its the last popsicle in the fridge because he wants that china money (just like every large American industry nowadays) and is willing to ignore the detention camps that are running in China, and imprisoning roughly a million Uighur people, just to get those profits... yet he wants to compromise the American Liberal belief that \"every man and woman is created equal\" by going to bed and doing lucrative business deals for his own gain...? (look at Ukraine and his dope-head son Hunter as an example, an unqualified peon who got a multimillion dollar job using daddies name so he can buy all the cocaine he wants). I guess Black Lives only matters to you when it fits your political agenda... China leads the world in stolen data and manufacturing counterfeit goods so I think they'll be fine dealing with Russia's \"fiendishly clever\" programmers with \"even more fiendishly clever\" programmers of their own. Get out of your parties narrative and open your mind. American politics play a sick game trying to pit us against each other just for the votes when there are even more horrendous atrocities out there waiting for the perfect moment to strike us at our weakest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(PS : in no way do i affiliate with either party whether it be Repub or Dems. If i had it my way, I would have left this sorry excuse of a country in the back of my mind and in the rearview mirror of my life by now had COVID not restricted travel\/relocating out of country \\[thanks Trump\\]. Both parties are culpable for the state of our country and if people could just get off their moral high horse for a solid minute and actually LOOK at where the money is going you'll realize just how fucked both parties are and how little they do for the everyday people trying to live their lives. I'm sure thats apparent with both parties inability to compromise on a covid relief deal while millions suffer economic losses that rival that of the Great Depression. But then Dems and Repubs alike wanna point fingers at the other as if middle ground is impossible to find. I hate Donald Trump just as much as the next never-trumper for being a do-nothing racist sexist pig, but oh hot damn did we go wrong when we chose yet ANOTHER do-nothing racist sexist pig but with a lil Xmas bow on top. The hypocrisy of both sides is quite astounding, and I guess the point I'm trying to make is that if you follow one specific political narrative, you're only getting a small percentage of the whole story. I don't want to make loss of life political whatsoever, however nowadays it seems if you think one superpower is an enemy you're automatically affiliated with this or that party which is simply untrue. don't be sheep, think for yourself, and FOLLOW THAT MONEY AND GUN TRAIL)."}

The conclusion is that Hitler was a failed socialist. In other words, his ideology was socialist, but it wasn't fully implemented yet. The video also goes over Hitler's quotes in Mein Kampf. He wanted a race-based collective system.\n\nAs for the paper, I don't know much about it. It seems to be a fringe paper, but that obviously doesn't make it false, but still. I'd rather go over the ideology rather than papers of supposed economic success under socialism or capitalism.\n\nI still view it as theft. I don't see how making a profit is stealing from workers and thereby needs to be corrected. Also, not every factory or business is a greedy capitalist with shady tactics or whatever you wanna call it. A lot are small businesses. Are you saying those should be stolen by the state too and redistributed equally? People should have the freedom to own stuff and buy and sell, etc. The government shouldn't dictate that beyond necessity.\n\nAgain, I suggest you to watch the video about Hitler's socialism.\n\nWhy should we focus on the collective (as it is with socialism)?

The gap is growing wider. Political party is one of the strongest correlations with vaccination rate.\n\nWe had several potential epidemics happen during Obama's administration. Zika, ebola, swine flu, bird flu. We had a pandemic task force that analyzed data from all over the world. Worked with the WHO, the CDC and responded quickly to get ahead of every potential infectious disease to come around. Guess who defunded and disbanded that? Trump. It's been long known that a really fucking nasty disease comes around about once per century. Last time it was Spanish flu. There were anti mask denialists back then too. Covid came right when it was expected, and Trump's immense incompetence ensured we were not prepared whatsoever.\n\nWe had even long anticipated that the new pathogen would be a zoonotic virus. From the region where Wuhan is. WE EVEN EXPECTED IT WOULD BE BATS. There are people who dedicate their life's work to forecasting infectious disease. The habitat loss, expansion and urbanization causing human contact with isolated populations of animals carrying pathogens that are thousands of years removed from our immune systems, is responsible for this and several other severe zoonotic pathogens. There's even documentaries predating covid about these people's research that spells out and makes this exact prediction.**It did not come out of a fucking lab in Wuhan.**\n\nIf you actually think BLM is destroying America, you're proving that part of the USA is a racist nation. Nobody ever said they want America destroyed. They want equal representation, but hey, Tucker Carlson, the guy who defends white supremacist terrorists after they're criminally charged, says BLM are terrorists. Republicans keep flagrantly misrepresenting and vilifying critical race theory, which is something that people could use to enact positive change. I guess in your cognitive dissonance, you think that must mean *America can't have any racism in it*\n\nThe camp you're in now is on the wrong side of history, and has been for decades. GOP is responsible for every shit war we've had in living memory. They're responsible for the garbage state of our economy and wealth gap from Reaganomics. I have plenty of criticisms of Democrats too. It is nowhere even remotely fucking equal. I'm not \"serving the forces of evil\". I'm in this sub laughing at all the people who die of their own evil.

That is 1% of the total voting population that will die. Now Trump will lose 53.5-46.5 instead of 53-47. Not much of a change.\n\nCovid just doesn't have much of an impact on killing voters, which is why the GOP doesn't care much.

They\u2019re honestly fucking superstars.\n\nThen others are just there to do their job. Very little talking or connecting, just get out and go, and are an hour or more late with your meds most of the time, and take an hour or more to answer your calls\/fulfill requests (if they ever do), like the food menu (before the cafeteria closes for the night!!!), water, make this fucking thing stop beeping again plz, blankets\/pillows, bedsheet or gown change, what time am I supposed to see doctor\/specialist\/have imaging\/diagnostics done, SERIOUSLY COME STOP THIS MOTHER FUCKING SHIT FROM BEEPING SO I CAN MOTHER FUCKING SLEEP PLEASE, etc\n\nAnd a few are so bad that they are 4-6 hours late with meds, even if everyone on the floor can hear you screaming and crying in agony. Good luck getting them to do literally anything else but meds too. They\u2019re just completely unreachable, and most of the time, the ALWAYS sweet PCAs had to step in and track them down for me to get anything done.\n\nMore on topic, I now have a home nurse come every 6 weeks for an infusion. She\u2019s great, but she couldn\u2019t make it last time.\n\nThis new nurse wasn\u2019t anti-Covid\/vaxx, but was otherwise totally into ~woo. \n\nShe tried to talk me out of my infusion by fear mongering about all the risks. My medication *is* a serious one, but it\u2019s because I need it. She kept telling me about how she had one of the cancers it increases your risk for, and how much damage it can do to your body, and how we still don\u2019t know long term effects, etc.\n\nAs though my doctor had never gone over any of this with me before\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nShe then suggested I seek out a naturopath, because there are all sorts of other options like essential oils, elixirs, flower essences, and making certain dietary changes (no GMO, no gluten, etc etc etc).\n\nJust totally fucking inappropriate.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why these nurses get into evidence based medicine if they\u2019re so much more interested in pseudoscience alternative medicine. Go be a homeopathic nurse if that\u2019s the shit you want to peddle."}

This is not a situation where we can just turn and look the other way and recognize their autonomy and personal choices.  These same people are arguing they shouldn't be restricted because they choose not to get the vaccine, which directly contributes to harming other innocent people.\n\n&gt;According to this sub they're still all sociopathic murders. \n\nThere are varying degrees of sociopathy.  Some are more toxic than others.  \n\nI'm sure a person that \"innocently\" tosses a lit cigarette out the window of their car, which ultimately causes tremendous loss of life, didn't intentionally mean to murder people.

I will say it\u2019s possible to overdose on it if you use large amounts of it that is meant and distributed for something like a cow or a horse as it is in a different form and is highly concentrated due to an animals size, so using large amounts of that would certainly put you in danger.

Prior to killing her baby, she may not have been in the same mental state a normal healthy teenager would've been in.

This is what happens when young girls grow up using social media which brainwashes them to believe abortions are morally justified and that a fetus is not a human being. This girl most definitely has mental illness and should not be released to the public. \n\nI am NOT excusing her for the actions she took. I even said she needs to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. \n\nA person who is so morally corrupt that they decide to stab their newborn to death in a shed will never be rehabilitated.

The reality was that these Khalistanis were also killing and pillaging sikhs, the houses they hid in, they raped the daughters, so the local civillians started helping the police to eliminate these militants.

{"text":"(I replied this to another person in this thread earlier. Apologies for the long message, brevity isn\u2019t my strong suit and this is a complex issue). Systemic racism is the idea that different government institutions (such as the criminal justice system or the police) and social institutions (hiring practices are a big one) are racist either intentionally and\/or in their consequences. An example of systemic hiring practice discrimination is the thought that a black person won\u2019t be a good \u201cfit\u201d for the job. The notion of them not \u201cfitting in\u201d is usually based in some notion of assumed significant difference in personality or behavior that the black applicant would have that white applicants don\u2019t. (here\u2019s a link of a study about hiring and job discrimination in Canada. http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.535.9197&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Just as an FYI this article is laid out a little oddly. Definitely look at the appendices tho.)\n\nAn important point here is that an individual person doesn\u2019t need to be explicitly racist for something like this hiring discrimination to happen. The person talking about \u201cfit\u201d might not think black people are biologically inferior. In fact in the vast majority of cases they won\u2019t think that. But they will have biases that are informed by their upbringing (like depictions in media, on the news, stereotypes heard in school or from friends\/family) that cause them to have implicit thoughts about black people that are racist.\n\nThis kind of occurrence is important for understanding racism in the present. Most people would find 1960\u2019s American racism to be abhorrent today. But cases like hiring discrimination are very harmful for black people, as well as women in some cases, without ever going towards clear racism like someone in the 1960\u2019s might have. Though to be clear there are still many cases of outright racism that happen today. But this less visible kind is more prevalent. Hiring discrimination is a systemic problem because of its prevalence, and because of how workplace norms are structured in a way that makes mainstream \u201cwhite culture\u201d default and preferred in the workplace. A black person is often assumed to operate under significantly different norms, and so they will not be able to fit will into the workplace environment. To be clear this is one example of hiring discrimination. Not all cases will be exactly like this. (See my link above) There are also cases where a policy might be \u201crace neutral\u201d in its wording. But will have a significant negative impact on one racial group. A big example from the US is agricultural and domestic workers. It getting job protection under the national labor relations act. Mostly people of color in the US work these jobs, and so they are disproportionately harmed by this policy, even tho it\u2019s race neutral in its wording.\n\nThis is a bit of an odd case in terms of definitions. The policy maker might be strongly anti-racist. But the consequences of such a policy are disproportionately harmful to some races. Calling the policy or policy maker racist is actually not necessarily accurate according to prevalent usages of the term racist. But regardless, this is a policy that causes many worker abuses, particularly to people of color, harming their life outcomes and contributing to racial inequality.  (Check this link for a solid explanation of \u201ccolorblind racism\u201d.\nhttps:\/\/guilfordjournals.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1521\/siso.70.3.431\n\nAnd this short one for some more basics on this: https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/psmag.com\/.amp\/news\/the-problem-with-race-neutral-policies\n\nAll these examples are in addition to regular old explicit racism that does still exist. If you aren\u2019t willing to read and engage with this material now that I\u2019ve made a decent (though still very incomplete) argument then idk know what to tell you"}
{"text":"You're missing my point. Yes, the ability to interact well with customers and coworkers is important. \n\nThe problem is that when people make judgements about who will be able to do that, people often will use stereotypes about the people we might be hiring. A black person in many cases will be stereotyped as not being a good fit amongst coworkers and customers based on those stereotypes. Its not that those aren't important considerations. Its that they are often leading to discriminatory outcomes due to racial stereotypes. In many cases the people that might not hire a black person because they ASSUME they wont be a good fit aren't explicitly racist at all. Nor are they secretly harboring racist views. They are just relying too much on stereotypes.\n\nWhen you say that people in the West are generally not racist in that they wouldn't avoid hiring based on race I pretty much agree. But because of erroneous stereotyping there can be an aversion to hiring certain groups. Such decision will have the outward appearance of being non-race based. But in many cases racial stereotypes will be the actual underlying reasoning. This is how racial discrimination can still exist even when being illegal. It can skirt using race explicitly, while still having it be a key part of decision. Again, even amongst people who aren't racist in the traditional sense. They are just exposed to stereotypes and use them in their thinking, which we all do. I'm not even accusing you in particular of doing this. But it is something that is prevalent. My link about Colorblind racism explains more of this.   \n\nAnd yes, having HR departments that can go over some hiring decisions can help with this problem. But many jobs aren't gov jobs, and many employers won't have HR departments. So those won't be able to help in many cases.  \n\nWhat did I mention about the US that was wrong? All I mentioned was the National Labor Relations Act? How was that wrong?"}

They'd have to go digging into statistics, or stumble upon a dissident opinion that hasn't been censored to see some semblance of the truth. And when someone speaks to the reality of the situation, it's so stark with the MSM narrative, that they have a hard to accepting it. The more radical leftists will accuse you of repeating stormfront talking points or some other bullshit to try to discredit you as well.\n\nCombine that with all the anecdotal evidence of maybe a dozen cases of police brutality, people's teary-eyed personal anecdotes of how their brother was innocently killed by police officers last year (he definitely was innocent of course, no he wasn't one of the 5 unarmed black men that weren't attacking police), and you have an extremely difficult time changing minds when regular people.\n\nYou almost have to spend an hour going through all the lies of MSM with a collection of evidence, along with showing counter-examples of protestors attacking and ganging up on innocent people, the impact it has on small business owners, clips of all the anti-white comments they make, show them all the statistics, just to deprogram a regular person and to get them open to your side.

People say the same thing about Jamaica, including Jamaicans, but completely forget that there are entire Maroon and rural communities that have kept far more indigenous influences than others. There was even a whole article written in one of the Jamaican newspapers on it a few years ago.

I don't know about Cuba, but I assume it's the same or more. \n\nFurthermore, nothing irks me more than when people simplify black in the Caribbean as being African slaves only. Our history, culture and genetics tells a story that it's far more complex than just people who are ONLY descended from African slaves. Regardless of whatever colonial power, the Caribbean didn't have the one-drop rule and being black in the Caribbean means acknowledging other ancestors too, be they Asian (including Indian), European or indigenous."}

Oh and also she has to like video games and anime. \n\nObviously these standards aren\u2019t the same across the board because each incel is a precious, unique, putrid flower. Some of them like to claim that they\u2019ll take \u201canything they can get\u201d and that they totally only hit on chicks that are their \u201clooksmatch\u201d but in reality all of them have ridiculously high standards.

You said science doesn't agree with me. I said false and elaborated on why. People are born male or female, being queer is a choice after that, usually coming from mental illness, brainwashed, or possesion. Being a choice, it is not a civil issue in supporting sodomy, but moral one.\n\nGender and sex (adjective meaning) is the same thing. Gender being a mental start of being is another word redefine.\n\nPeople are born the sex they are for the entirety of their life. Sexual orientation is a choice. Only liers say that people can be born gay.\n\n&gt;Okay then stop trying to make your esoteric rules into laws\n\nWhat kind of person thinks anti abortion laws are esoteric?\n\n P.s. christian principles are very simple and straight forward.

You should be kind to people and never treat them in ways that will harm their mental health, but no one should feel like they owe someone time and attention because they might kill themselves otherwise. \n\nManipulators love threatening suicide, and they do it because they know it forces people to come running to their aid. Even if the person isn\u2019t a manipulator and is genuinely suicidal though, it\u2019s not fair to put pressure on someone to dedicate their whole life to them lest they make a permanent exit.\n\nI know what it like to be lonely and feel worthless. I know what it\u2019s like to think of ending it all. I absolutely think we should support people and be kind. I also think it\u2019s important to understand that someone\u2019s suicide is their own choice, not the fault of someone else who didn\u2019t give them enough attention."}

Woukd you have a nice coffee with someone wo wants violence to be committed against you?\" Basically, he was arguing that if you consider taxation theft with the threat if violence, and your mother supports taxation to pay for healthcare, your mother wants you to be a slave, so you should cut her out.\n\nAs this militant streak expanded, he started only tackling debate partners on the left, rather than just anyone, and developed obsessions with race and sex theory. He's no scientist or doctor, so he should stay away from deciding on mating suitability for hest happiness yield based on your race or IQ.\n\nNow he's obsessed with making young white people BREED because young brown people BREED like crazy. A true 180 from where he started.  \n\nOr, maybe he was just mad all along, and good at hiding it until 2015 or so."}

Women value a lot of different things, but the one thing they search for most consistently in a partner is sincerity.\n\nNo, not sincerity as in heartwarming and wholesome. You can be sincerely an asshole or sincerely kind, and there\u2019s a type of girl who will go for each. It\u2019s about being confident and true in the person that you\u2019re outwardly presenting yourself to be.\n\nThe reason why being an asshole is often appealing (and yes it is) is because it signals that you\u2019re not modifying your behavior to make someone else like you (whether or not you actually are). But there\u2019s a similar appeal to being genuinely kind or creative or funny or driven or any other variety of qualities provided that it appears to be an authentic representation of who you are."}

When you feel better about yourself, you automatically look better. There are few things more of a turnoff than desperation. Confidence is attractive. Confidence is also not the same as being an asshole.\n\nConfidence means being secure in yourself, and not bringing down others. There is nothing better than someone who is full of sincere compliments to other people, and accepts compliments in themselves because they believe them."}
{"text":"Hey man,\n\nThe rest of the comments are piling on you and it made me feel bad. They may be right but they are definitely being assholes about it.\n\nLet me start off by saying I feel you dude. Dating is hard. It's hard when you're not classically handsome or tall or white ( I am none of the above). It's hard being confident when everyone else makes being confident look easy. It is ok to feel the way you are feeling and, as a mid 20sish virgin engineer (didn't need to repeat myself ha!) I feel the same way many days.\n\n\nBut I'll clue you onto a secret that helped me. Women are people too. They're nothing more nothing less. Think about it man, really think about it. Anything you're into, there's a lady that's into it. There are lady gamers and lady comic book nerds and even lady incels (it's a thing). They're just people like you or I. We're not NPCs dude. We look at each other as people, not a collection of tickboxes or stat checks. It's less like an MMORPG and more like DnD (or maybe dark souls idk) dude, it's open and there's no stat check thatll unlock the magic sex box. A girlfriend is not an accessory, they're a whole person just like you who eats, breathes, thinks, shits, wanks etc etc and they made a decision to be with their partner based on more than just a checklist of things.\n\nGoing back to your premise for a sec: If genetics and looks are so important why the fuck do crackheads seem to always manage to get into a relationship (it's a joke y'all chill I know that its not necessarily a choice to be an addict). I've known poor dudes in relationships, ugly dudes, anxious dudes, skinny dudes, fat dudes, all types of dudes get into relationships (hell even fellow engineering students hahaha). Seriously, if you want to have hope search up Bobby Lee the comedian and his girlfriend Khalyla Khun. There are supermodel men and actors who are single.\n\nBut you gotta be realistic in a sense too. What do YOU have to offer that supermodel waifu of your dreams? I'm sure your personality is awesome and you're a lovely person when people get to know you but, accepting for a second that women are not merely cumsocks but whole women, what have you done that might appeal to them? More to the point, how have you worked on yourself to improve in those aspects? I personally don't want a perfect woman - can you imagine how fucking tiring that would be? And if I would be so bold to speak for womankind, most aren't looking for perfect men either (and the ones who are, generally lead to heartbreak anyway so save yourself the time)\n\n\nIdk this took me on a ramble but I guess the key thing I want to get across to you is that we are all people and you and I are not special or unique. This means for every lonely dude like you or I there's a lonely girl struggling with the same inadequacy and lack of self confidence and difficulties with the whole dating experience. Realise that, when you really stop to think about it, things like high\/low status, bone structure, pills etc are all really absurd (and I say this as someone dangerously close to going down this path). People aren't NPCs. They're people, living their lives with their own concerns and thoughts and decision making processes and you can't boil anyone down to a series of stats. \n\n\nIf you do anything at all, I'd recommend you search Day9 dating advice on YouTube. Day9 was a starcraft pro (fucking top tier nerd) and commentator who still managed to get married. You can do it dude. It's not easy, it's very discouraging and I haven't fucking puzzled it out either but it's possible. This is an open and good faith invite: I'm open to chatting to you or any dude who's feeling down about dating in DM. I can't promise I'll fix your problems but I can at least offer solidarity and support that won't lead you down to bitterness and anger."}

{"text":"I think you are conflating concepts and making unsubstantiated leaps in logic.\n\nThe POC label is derived from what the US considers to be \u201cWhite\u201d, which is frankly quite arbitrary. The umbrella of Whiteness contains numerous cultures, including German, Italian, Caucasian, etc. As a result, anyone that is not one of those, is a \u201cperson of color\u201d. The term is also purposefully strongly associated with more melanated people, regardless of ethnicity, due to the history of skin-based racism in the US and other Western countries. \n\nAs in, your previous comment about \u201cculture\u201d is fairly irrelevant to what the label is supposed to encompass, hence my confusion.\n\n&gt;\tAs a jew im not even considered white and i know im not considered \"a poc\". \n\nI\u2019ve heard of Jewish people being referred to as POC before, but I\u2019m not sure how common that is. I think Jewish people fall into an \u201cother\u201d category, due to their history as a specific protected class, following WW2, and the distinction between the followers of Judaism and people that are ethnically Jewish. (https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Who_is_a_Jew%3F)\n\nIf you\u2019re point is that Jewish people still face discrimination, then I agree. I don\u2019t think anyone worth listening to would say otherwise. \n\n&gt;\tREally not even considered a person.\n\nBy who? Clearly no one that you should pay any mind too.\n\nI think the divide between Jews and the POC movement just comes down to a difference in priorities. I\u2019ve noticed that issues of racism in the community are almost always dealt with in a vacuum, irrespective of other groups that may be facing discrimination."}

{"text":"No, let me explain the differences and nuances between fascism and national socialism. Nazi Germany was by no means fascist, but national socialist. Fascism is a purely constructive ideology predicated on a dictatorship of the people for the people. Generally, I'm centre-right on social issues and center-left on economics, and I am more of a trade protectionist and trade unionist than a Nazi. National Socialism is predicated upon a belief of a rigid system of racial dominance. Fascism is predicated upon the people working together to secure a homeland for themselves and a future for their children. Fascism is, by design, benevolent, as committing genocides is an anti-fascist action. Generally, fascists are just very much in favor of trade isolationism, closed borders, generous welfare programs for citizens, and public spending. National Socialism is in favor of genocide, expanding borders, militarism, expansionism, concentration of power in corporate bodies, and private spending. Sure fascists have done bad things, just like everyone else, but most of those things were either out of desperation or foreign influence."}

You don't care about Muslims coming in, even though they are among the most violent demographics in America? But white people in America are bad because they want more whites? Make it make sense.\n\nI do not like foreigners represented in my media, and evidently, enough Japanese don't either, otherwise there would be more black anime.

(the glitch relied on a specific wormhole type and class, so it could only be used in a few systems, including their home)\n\n Eventually a different group attacked them, and although they failed they managed to get a few kills, revealing the fits of the defenders and noticing that their ranges were weird.

After watching this political dance for the las 25 years, I have come to the conclusion that red and blue is 2 sides of the same coin. I posed this question back in 2015, \"How the hell did we end up with Hillary and Trump as our final 2 picks?\" And in 2020 I asked, \"How is Biden the best we can come up with to run against Trump?\" If we as a nation would quit voting these asshats and career politicians, we might could see some real change in this world.

But it is about the undermining of mail in voting, the reduction in polling locations and their available hours in a targeted fashion in minority neighborhoods and cities in red states, making it illegal to offer people water ffs, looking at you georgia sb 202. \n\n&gt;I don\u2019t believe that in most cases you have the right to an abortion because that is another life and you don\u2019t have the right to take it without due cause\n\nWhose job is it to decide if it's the right course of action? Yours? That's literally the definition of bodily autonomy. You may not agree, but it's not your decision to make. We're just ideaologically opposed here, I think. Neither of us is going to convince to other that our view on this particular topic is the right one, but I would say regardless of what you think about abortion it's a question of whether you believe you have a right to force your view on others.\n\n&gt;Last, if you can point to a law that is on the books that marginalizes minorities or show me a right that a minority doesn\u2019t have that others have, I\u2019ll fight along side you in opposing that.\n\nKansas House Bill 1570 outlaws hormone treatment therapy for trans youth. And there are many other bills like it being considered in conservative lead legislatures around the country. I know most conservatives believe this is saving children from leftist experimentation and a lifetime of confusion and suffering, but the decision to transition in adolescence is one that's made with the family of the youth and the medical community under great careful consideration and is not something anyone has the right to outlaw. This is just yet another case of conservatives pushing their ideals on the rest of the country in an attempt to win some self-percieved culture war.\n\nAnd now that I have a little more time to continue my rebuttal of your previous comment I would like to add a few more points. You say you don't believe your tax dollars should go to funding contraception availability. But would you rather it go to funding state run guardianship programs and foster care? Because those costs will increase if contraceptives aren't made available and the quality of life for those kids will be low in many cases. Is it not better to prevent unwanted pregnancies than to deal with the aftermath and force unwanted children to live a life of being shuttled around from caregiver to caregiver?\n\nAdditionally: please, show me where leftists are wholesale celebrating abortion. Because if there are people celebrating the act of terminating a pregnancy for its own sake, I'll join you in denouncing that. You know why that won't happen though? Because the left doesn't celebrate abortion for its own sake, it simply champions the cause of making it available for those who need it.\n\nUltimately the issue I have with conservativism in America is that at its core it's just a vehicle for white christians to enforce the restrictions of their religious beliefs on others through government. Which is ironically one of the things the US government is not supposed to do according to our professed ideaology: seperation of church and state and all that. Conservatives aren't pro-life, they're just anti-abortion. If they were pro-life they'd be for universal healthcare to elevate and care for those lives once they arrived in this world and they'd be for tighter gun control to help stop so many of those lives being snuffed out. It's a contradictory ideaology based on resisting change out of fear of an apocalypse that just isn't coming. And it's so out of touch with reality because it's built on religious ideaology that is in and of itself focused on an extra-reality afterlife and feelings rather than trying to navigate the world that we're in now in a way that's inclusive and empathetic."}

So far, we don't know the answer. Nobody has proved, once and for all, that it's right. But they've found pretty good signs that it might be.\n\nCritics of the idea like to point to a 2001 study prepared for Congress by the National Center for Education Statistics. Although some earlier stabs at the topic had detected traces of the Bennett hypothesis in certain areas of higher-ed, the NCES found absolutely no association between the availability of most types of financial aid, including loans and government grants, and tuition costs. Unfortunately, the study had a lot of limitations. In so many words, the report's authors cautioned that they didn't have the right data or the right theoretical models to arrive at a solid conclusion.\u00a0\n\nIn the years since, several academics have taken a crack at the problem, and each study has unearthed slightly different answers. \u00a0A team from Cornell University, for instance,\u00a0found that increases in the size of Pell Grant awards, need-based state aid, and the availability of subsidized loans caused public universities to hike up their tuition for in-state students. Out-of-state tuition, however, wasn't affected.\u00a0\nThose findings clashed with the results of another study, from the University of Oregon, which looked specifically at Pell Grants, one of President Obama's favored forms of student aid. The researchers discovered \"little evidence\" linking increases in the size of Pell Grants to in-state tuition at public universities. Private schools were a different story. There, increases in Pell aid were \"matched nearly one for one\" by tuition hikes.\nThen there's the for-profit education sector, which may well work on its own set of rules. In a study released this month, professors from Harvard and George Washington University compared tuition prices at for-profit schools where students were eligible for federal student loans to costs at schools where students were not eligible. The researchers estimated that at schools where the loans were available, tuition was roughly 75 percent higher.\u00a0\n\nIt makes basic sense that if you subsidize something, you'll get more of it. If you give money to consumers, demand rises and prices follow. We're learning that painful lesson every year as healthcare costs soar in this country. But because colleges vary so much in their missions, and how the operate, it may be impossible to make a blanket statement about the affect of aid on their costs. Harvard wants to be the most prestigious university in the world, and may be willing to spend any extra bit of income to do it, whether the money comes from student aid or alumni donations. The University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh wants to give middle class (or aspiring middle class) students a sound education, and might be more inclined to keep costs low, regardless of how much money the government funnels its way. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe same issue goes for students themselves. Some 18-year-olds and their families might be willing to spend whatever it takes to get a prestigious Ivy League degree. Others just want an education that won't saddle them with too much debt.\u00a0\n\nAndrew Gillen of the Center for College Affordability &amp; Productivity has tried to address these issues\u00a0with a theory\u00a0he calls The Bennett Hypothesis 2.0. Offering aid to truly needy students isn't a problem, he argues. But when you offer it to students who might otherwise still be able to pay for a college education, you drive up costs. Unfortunately, because of the way the government collects student aid data, it's hard to put that theory to the test.\u00a0\nSo we don't know if Bennett was 100 percent right, but he might not have been totally off the mark either. It's too bad it's taken more than two decades for policy makers to start talking about solutions for a complicated problem.\u00a0"}

After I started seeing it used by people who WERE broadcasting racist ideals I just.... Stopped making that hand gesture. Hasn't hurt me in the slightest. To me, it doesn't mean anything racist. However I KNOW that a large portion of the population see's it as a wink and a nudge for white supremesists, so why risk giving someone the wrong impression? It sucks, but it's the world we live in and no amount of stubbornness is going to change it. It will just drag us down with the actual scum \ud83d\ude14"}

In hindsight, we view this as justified because most of us don't approve of slaveholding, but the South viewed it as gross government overreach. Were they correct? Probably. But fundamentally, the cause of the war was slavery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, of course they said it wasn't about slavery. That would've made them look worse, as the stated reason for the war was that the South seceded from the union. But why do you think they seceded? Because they viewed the North's efforts to prevent them from owning slaves as unconstitutional and government overreach. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yes, it was 100% about slavery. If you do a bunch of mental gymnastics, you can say it was because of government overreach, but ultimately the root cause of the conflict was disagreements over how to handle slavery."}

Almost like there\u2019s always another side to everything. Like both sides might have a valid viewpoint even as the truth lies closer to the center. Last year was either full of righteous peaceful protests, or violent riots depending on your viewpoint. And how much nuance your willing to employ. \n\nAgain to you it\u2019s a symbol of hate, the confederate battle flag. That doesn\u2019t mean it is or that the people using it think that way either. Again there are Americans who view the American flag the same way you view the confederate battle flag. Are they right? Who gets to chose and does that apply to everyone? I don\u2019t think the American flag is a symbol of racism and hate, to me it\u2019s the opposite.

You can\u2019t just trespass into the Capitol, fight with cops, and destroy federal property while causing a massive lockdown of elected officials without repercussions (unless you live in Portland). We are, ostensibly, a nation of laws. But taking what mostly amounted to people walking around taking selfies and trespassing and trying to turn that into a world-shaking insurrection was a massive stretch, in my opinion. It was also a blatantly political ploy by people who wanted to use what happened as a partisan cudgel. That\u2019s how we got the theater of fortifying the Capitol for three months.\"\n\nThis is a fact.  The above is something that cannot be denied.  There were no firearms, and no one died from another person _intending on killing them_ except for Aski Babbit, who was killed by an officer that has STILL not been identified.  Do you ever wonder why this officer still has not been identified?\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/davereaboi\/status\/1376871678257602563\n\nDid you know that officer Sicknick was never hit with a fire extinguisher, and we now know that with 100% certainty?  Did you know that not a single firearm was found inside the building, and that the people that entered the capitol building on that day are, at worst being charged with trespassing and disorderly conduct?  It was not an insurrection, and if you think it was, then you might want to take a few breaths and look up the definition of the word.  Do some research on things.\n\nhttps:\/\/amgreatness.com\/2021\/02\/14\/the-new-york-times-retracts-the-sicknick-story\/\n\n\nYou melted down on January 6th because CNN wanted you to.

That's what happens in a healthy relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;He\u2019s given up everything that gave his life value.\n\nThat's a wild conclusion to come to for someone that you've never actually interacted with. You don't know anything about his personal life and what gives his life value. It's clear his relationship with his wife does because he's being supportive here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Harry is far worse of an individual for throwing his own family under the bus in public and smearing them as racists with no evidence. He lived with these people for years and this is how he treats them? What a scumbag.\n\nYou know **nothing** about what these people are like when the cameras are off. Harry has lived with these people his entire life and if he's supporting his wife's claims then maybe they're true? You don't know anything about what they're actually like. Harry does. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I know men like this who get married to the wrong person despite absolutely everyone warning them not to, only to see them later get divorced and screwed over, but not before they\u2019ve burnt every bridge possible with their family and friends.\n\nCool anecdotal evidence? I know plenty of people who help their partner stand up to toxic family members. Anecdotes don't mean anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;So yeah, Harry is dumb. Solid gold snatch. They\u2019re both equally pathetic to me.\n\nSo a man who's family you know **nothing** about is dumb and the only reason he could possibly love his wife is her vagina?"}

They don't hold meaningful power, they lack privilege in certain areas.

I agree with you that there are definitely factors well outside of race that have an impact on how people are treated. And that there are numerous white people (mainly low income) that are suffering. Tragedy is tragedy. They need help too. I agree with you on that.\n\nThe only difference we have is that I'm saying race is another way people are disenfranchised. That's where I'm going to have to leave it. It's not linear. It's not more or less important than classism. I'm simply saying it's another factor.\n\nI wish you luck."}

Native American people in general are the most likely group to commit suicide in the US. \n\nThird, the largest percentage of suicides worldwide is Japanese men, not white men.

Meghan, who is part black, would get security, but their child, who would be even less black, would not? It's meaningless, and, again, I don't believe it. No reason to believe them.\n\n&gt;You are not reading it thoroughly because I said that it doesn't matter the status of the person being attacked, ALL matters. But you don't seem to care for them due to their status so you are pointing at yourself?\n\nI don't understand what you you're saying.\n\n&gt;Treating a child different due to its color is more than impolite\n\nThat child hasn't been \"treated\" in any way, yet. Someone supposedly, but probably didn't, ask an impolite question about the baby. \n\n&gt;I haven't dismissed your pain, on the opposite I have numerous times said that its not OK about that stat.\n\nSaying it's not OK doesn't mean much when it's followed by a\n\n&gt;However,\n\nYou are dismissing people's pain.\n\n&gt;you can't say with a straight face that in this world that white men have it the hardest?\n\nFirst off, some could. What do you know? Who's to say? Them committing suicide at extremely high rates should give us a clue. Should. Second, you might be wrong, and being wrong in this instance creates even more suffering. That view, that white men don't have it harder than others simply based on their skin color, spread across a culture, is a good way to make sure hurting people don't get help. Again, the suicide rates give us a hint. Maybe you don't know as much as you think.\n\n&gt;Yes, in suicide rates but there are more stuff in the world as well\n\nYeah, offing yourself isn't enough to show that your pain is legitimate, or that you're worth being loved or cared for. White men don't have real problems, I mean, sure, they're committing suicide, literally ending their lives, but what does that really tell us? Such a fucking jaded, cynical view.\n\nI've been pretty close myself, but I have to tell you, the attitude you have is one that many, many people have, and it makes me even now think that being here isn't all that worth it. When I say I'm not doing well, people roll their eyes, like you're doing now. Maybe if I was British royalty, you'd care more.\n\nWhen you say, \"you can't say with a straight face that in this world white men have it the hardest,\" what I'm hearing is, \"even if you have it bad, so bad that you're willing to commit suicide, I've been told by people I trust that it's not that bad, and you don't matter enough to care about.\" And, you're probably right."}

Don't let women work or vote, use people as slaves. Just because it's an old way of doing stuff, doesn't mean it's good\n\nDo you know what argumentative fallacies are? You managed to use two in as many sentences. Bringing up two unrelated issues to this one is a red herring, and since I didn't argue that I held my position because it was old is a false premise. I could just as easily say to you that just because it's old, doesn't make it bad.\n\nThe wisdom of the ages, though, is on my side in this case, and from pretty much everywhere, not just western tradition or Christianity. Hell, even all the commies and socialists from the last century agreed. Mao, Che, Lenin, Castro, etc. Sexual degeneracy is destructive to a society, while the family is its anchor."}

{"text":"&gt; It should go up not down. It\u2019s inflation not deflation.\n\nYou\u2019re trying to argue in favor of common sense. That was your first mistake. Shareholder capitalism isn\u2019t trying to make the lives of workers better.\n\nDoorDash is not a very profitable company. They are just slowly bleeding. They just raised the delivery fees for customers, which in turn is going to make customers want to tip less. At the same time, they updated the base pay model which originally was just $3 flat for any delivery. If it kept getting declined, they\u2019d tack on an extra $0.25. But now, any order that is under like 6 miles is $2.25 base pay, and anything over 7 miles could be $4-$4.50 base pay. Most of the time I\u2019m not going to take those long-distance orders, because I\u2019d rather deliver something 3.5 miles or less.\n\nSo with increased customer fees, customers will be tipping less, and DoorDash has lowered the base pay for drivers. Now that base pay is $2.25, they lowered the base pay for stack orders to $2 (when you get offered two orders at once, or when waiting on one order you get offered something on the route). It used to be that if you were dropping off an order, you wouldn\u2019t get offered anything else until you were done. But now I get notifications offering me an order for after I drop it off, because DoorDash wants to pay me less, since that counts as a stack order they can pay me $2 base pay.\n\nThey aren\u2019t interested in paying drivers more. They\u2019re considered independent contractors so we really get the shaft. DoorDash offers referral bonuses to people who refer friends and then that person completes X amount of deliveries in (usually) 60 days. New drivers also get delivery bonuses from challenges like $200 for 20 deliveries. They don\u2019t want to pay drivers more, they are relying on a constant cycle of new drivers signing up who don\u2019t know how to make the most money out of driving so they accept shitty orders. Then they catch on, they cherry pick good orders, and then DoorDash relies on new drivers joining and the cycle repeats.\n\nI hope that after this year when I finish my degree I don\u2019t have to work for DoorDash. But yeah, I know that was a lot to read but it\u2019s some insight into how DoorDash operates here in America."}

{"text":"All these Western countries that support Israel and Zionism so much could easily accept these Settler (European\/White) Jews as immigrants to their countries. The only issue is that the Mizrahi (Middle Eastern) Jews (and Yemeni and Ethiopian immigrant Jews) have been largely absorbed into Israeli settler society, but they decided that for themselves, as they knew they would be advantaged as part of settler society. Though if these Mizrahi Jews can prove that their (great) grandparents (or other family) lived on the land before the creation of the (illegitimate) state of Israel, or more sensibly, before the British Mandate of Palestine, then they could be permitted to stay. Anyways, White colonizers being kicked out is nothing new... see Algeria (probably the best example), Uganda (?) (South Asians too later on, though arguably less legitimate), South Africa (to a considerable extent), etc. Once the system stops benefitting them the settlers will leave on their own accord anyways."}

{"text":"Under the impression we all had that they *were* cheating, yes. Turns out that ESL changed the rules without Valve's consent, so it was a grey area and they weren't *actually* breaking the rules, so Notail was wrong in this instance. You are allowed to call out teams for breaking the rules if you think they are breaking the rules lol.\n\nBut you are conflating two different scenarios. There's a difference between calling out a team for cheating when you think they are cheating, and saying another team is bad because they are bad. One is uncalled for, especially when it's consistent.\n\nThe same thing with being cocky. There is nothing wrong with a sense of boisterous cockiness, like Gorgc saying that he can't wait to face OG and keep them in Division 2. Gorgc didn't come out and exclaim that \"OG are rubbish players\" for over a year.\n\nIf OG just came out and left a Tweet saying \"Team Liquid are dogshit Dota players\", and did it constantly  for over a year, that would be insanely innapropriate. But I can't think of anything similar to that that OG has done. They are definitely cocky and talk themselves up, which is different from putting other people down. They use voice lines in game, which I think is totally fair. Everyone just seems to think OG deserve it because it's OG."}
{"text":"Sooo you can call people braindead and that is okish talk, but for other people calling someone piece of shit is a no go."}
{"text":"Falls under the same vein as cheating as I spoke about earlier. Calling someone a coward for what you perceive to be breaking the rules is a valid label.\n\nAgain, it's different than consistently putting someone down because of who they are."}
{"text":"Years ago my 4.5 ass got into a game with Ceb on my team because i queued at 4am. I played pos1 and got absolutely destroyed in lane but ended up carrying the game. Ceb was trash talking me the whole time but honestly, he wasnt that rude. He was passive aggressive and sarcastic and he wouldnt shut up about me even when we turned it around, but overall it wasnt that horrible and i actually laughed at some of his insults."}
{"text":"I mean at least Notail had the balls to say what everyone was thinking, even if it wasn't eloquently said. Sure Alliance played within the rules, but using a coach in game is a whole other game than normal competitive DotA. \n\nI do think pro games influence pubs a lot and if there's toxic behavior in pro games it'll be imitated in pubs, which just leads to a toxic experience for all. However I don't blame OG using it as a tool to win TI. Don't you think reddit sentiment is a bit inconsistent then? Couple weeks ago reddit were soychamping over Emo's questionmark and now they are critiquing OGs tips\/sprays\/voicelines. I think all chatting is way more toxic than tipping."}
{"text":"Usually when you have a problem with someone, you go talk to the person you have a problem with first, and if that is to no avail you take it up the ladder. Ceb sent private messages to the person he had a problem with and then instead of responding he published the private messages.\n\nCould Ceb have been less blunt in the private messages? Sure, but he isn't the one who started this."}
{"text":"Are you really comparing sprayin and voice lining in game to trash talking in twitter?"}
{"text":"Okay but it's Ceb who said that... so are you agreeing with me then?  Cool"}
{"text":"Ceb is an asshole and Notail fucked up with Alliance, but they're playing the game, taking risk. Mid or meepo is a dude being paid to trashtalsk OG 24\/7, I'm amazed that nobody sees how fucked up is that, and what bad precedent it settles."}
{"text":"I think it's context related. OG fountain-farming Brame while spraying \"loser\" outside leaves a really bad taste because OG (reigning TI champions btw) were the clear favourites coming in. If OG did that vs say, Secret, it would be completely fine IMO but when it's kicking down like that they just come off as assholes. If Brame had talked shit before the game it would be different of course, but as the \"bigger\" team you should think twice about initiating trash talk towards smaller teams, or at least do it in a way which is more funny than just straight up mean.\n\nWith that said I think they should absolutely be allowed to do it, it's just distasteful when you're clearly the stronger team and you start bullying the weaker team."}
{"text":"That's because it is, this whole drama shit is fucking dumb. Ceb sent a DM to someone who was once his friend, now isn't, trying to handle it in private, as a normal human being does, then it get's posted all over socials? Dude, that's fucking trashy no matter what way you phrase it or sell it."}
{"text":"Secret Twitter is just giving the crowd what it wants - if you check Reddit, the overall attitude towards OG is very similar."}
{"text":"You just used a stereotype about a country to explain one asshole\u2019s behaviour. That\u2019s bigotry. \n\nHaving heard the stereotype doesn\u2019t make it any more acceptable. \n\nTrash the idiot. I\u2019m not french. But I live in France.

{"text":"Kinda funny that hes been obviously targeting OG and now that Ceb targets him he plays the victim"}
{"text":"Okay, let me ask you, do you think that makes you a better person than someone who used to be racist as a teenager, and no longer is now as an adult?"}
{"text":"He is getting paid to do that, if they wanted something different they wouldn't have hired him in first place.\n\nI'm not excusing him, I'm saying that is what trolls do, they will focus on being a pain in the ass to someone that it will look like is personal, that is my answer to your \"it is personal\" argument that you are trying to enforce here.\n\n \n\n&gt;t is clear he loves the attention and drama\n\nThat is literally the reason why he got hired, people love it. If he was shitting on GH the same way he is doing to OG THEN we would have a problem, because he clearly isn't part of that game. Ceb and notail wanted to play his game by being controversial with their words, because saying stupid things like they did will have backlash, the best way to troll them is to remind them how stupid they were when they said that."}
{"text":"I agree to a point. But returning world champions trashing on a lower end team after a stomp is just kind of lame stuff.\n\nThe thing with esports, is that you are still just behind a screen. Shit that started huge fights in my hockey games, are not anywhere near the shit that is said in dota. Like Ceb says things that would get his block knocked off in an athletic competition.\n\nIt's not a \"too tough for others\" sort of thing, it's just a child hiding behind a computer that throws shit at others."}
{"text":"Ceb sounds and looks (and is) the shit head here. Can't believe you think that message isn't meant to be offensive. What a joke."}

{"text":"&gt; Also ceb might be toxic and might be a dick\n\nmight?\n\nNot that I agree with bullying at all but when you were a fucking bully your entire career, it's not that surprising to get bullied back."}
{"text":"&gt;If you think \"we all did that\" you're just also a racist asshole.\n\n...Why are there like three people in here acting like I said this, with you even going so far as to put it in quotes, when I never said anything remotely like that? Do your fucking brains just go on autopilot down an NPC dialogue tree whenever anyone discusses a given topic?\n\nReread my post and then try again."}
{"text":"When you typed this out, I wonder if you say the same when ceb blatantly made fun of other teams after og won.\n\nStop being double-standard and ass-licking. It will aid in your judgement."}
{"text":"Imagine having such a fucking smooth brain that you think adults murdering people is just as bad as a 16 year old using naughty words online.\n\nTry thinking for 30 seconds before you say anything next time, might help you avoid posting something this catastrophically stupid in the future."}

{"text":"the Dota folk sure have it good. As a Tekken and Overwatch player as well, its a shame people don't know how good of a game and its experience has been for us. Everytime I look at another game, its insane how much valve does for Dota. We don't even have ads in the biggest tournament of the year, and valve could've easily brokered deals with companies for it.\n\nPlayers contribute towards the prizepool, but valve itself pays for the tournamet, whatever the amount maybe. I like the fact that they don't 'control' the scene.\n\nDota will live and die by its community with valve more or less being its stewards more than developers and I dont know many games that can claim the same, its in one out of maybe 5 games on this planet that does that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for inviting Gorgc, I watch gorgc's stream, and he participated in the qualifiers to compete at TI, why would valve consider him for talent ?\n\nLets say valve is looking to invite teams that didn't make it, what qualifies gorgc over someone from Nigma or Liquid ?\n\nHeck SumaiL was more uncertain to be at TI than Gorgc before 2 months, and HE wasn't on the radar of talent."}
{"text":"Backseaters miss the point that discovering things for yourself is the entire reason most people play games.\n\nAnd honestly, it's not even that easy of a lesson to teach, I know cause I've been there, watching a friend play a game that I know through and through, it can be kind of hard to prevent yourself from telling them how to play the game, because you see every mistake they make.\n\nThe only case someone should be even remotely backseated is when they ask for help, if I'm playing an ARPG, and doing some dogshit build that I personally enjoy because I'm immersed with it or whatever, the absolute LAST thing I wanna hear in the universe is how unoptimized it is and how I should reroll into the better spec. Or even anything remotely close to that, like the cheeky 'Man, it's cool how you can make this awful build work xDDD' pretending to not be a backseater."}

Streamers getting offered these sponsor deals dont need the money and I cannot understand how money keeps being a motivator once you get past 1M dollars a year.

Giving up on basic principles for a big money payout can only lead you down a path of extreme unhappiness and suffering. I refuse to believe the streamers accepting this kind of money dont live with a huge amount of shame and stress that is entirely a result of selling out constantly and sacrificing their decency. \n\nThese gambling streamers are themselves completely addicted to gambling and have lost all sense of happiness outside of the gambling high. Theres nothing worse than when an addict starts profiting off and in turn fuels their own addiction.\n\nA Trainwreck waiting to happen :)"}

I don't enjoy banning people, its not fun. But we won't let the experience be ruined for others and the streamer, but everyone can get a 2nd chance for a backseating ban.\n\nAlso please think of the irony of calling me and others names while we are \"bullies\""}

{"text":"Reread the conversation. This started by saying tweeting about this is useless, to which you agreed and called it futile but for some reason it's still useful(?). I pointed out that futile means there will be no change and used an analogy of a tweet attempting to \"fix\" a broken leg, to which you suggested that it would be more productive to physically go and stop what broke his leg. Now I will point out my solution was to get an ambulance, not to \"stop\" what broke his leg. This would be analogous to physically protesting Valve instead of tweeting, since Valve is the one that can fix the behavior you disagree with, similar to how an ambulance would be able to fix the broken leg.\n\nNow all that being said, I'd like to refer you back to when you yourself said that tweeting about this issue is futile. So in reality you agree with me, but are too lazy to actually do something that is more than completely useless. Go ahead and reply again, it will only further prove me correct."}

Just small comments peppered into movies and TV shows, that don't really have anything to do with the plot. Then we pressure teenagers, who normally wouldn't be interested in having sex at their age, into having sex with each other and they develop the mentality that this is normal pretty early on.\n\nI'm not saying the world was better centuries ago, but one of the worst developments in modern culture was the idea that people should just screw everything that lets them and have lots and lots of sex with so many different people. Some social circles will make you feel like you are a freak if you *aren't* having hookups. I remember lying in middle school that I lost my virginity at a young age, because every girl around me was already being groomed into thinking that having sex made her \"cool\". Hopefully others were lying for attention like I was, because looking back, it was horrifying - those girls were like 12 years old. I know some of them had sex because I skipped class to buy pregnancy tests with another middle schooler once. She got several STDs from a disgusting grown man that groomed her.\n\nI don't make excuses for pickmes, they are usually grown women with the mental capacity to figure these things out, but I understand why they become this way.

And openly talks about his issues with 'emotions', yet gives people shit for being weak when he himself couldn't handle his own depression. Not exactly a HV quality.\n\nFourth - The fact that you somehow skipped or missed all of the interviews that he's done where he openly says women were happier in the 1950's as housewives serving the family... aka indentured servitude, is astounding to me, because he makes that claim, a LOT. He's also made this claim when he spoke to Jokko Wilink in an interview on his Podcast stating that there's a 'hierarchy' that needs to be respected for the sake of order... which ties into his affiliations with white supremacists and authoritarian organizations.\n\nEdit: Adding another point...\n\nTo anyone reading Mommajamma-204's responses, pay attention, this is either actually secretly a guy, or this is a the work of a woman who is actually not there to support other women. The tactful manipulation to 'find the facts' but actually ignore the facts that are there to make a case are astounding. Their comments are actually littered with red-flags. They admit that he says cringe-worthy stuff, but still support him? A basic FDS principle is if a guy says and repeatedly comments on something, like 1950's housewives were the happiest, that's total BS and we all know that here.

{"text":"I couldn't possibly do the full version justice in a comment like this, but I will try the shirt version. I grew up in a different Christian church but had started to doubt God's existence, etc. Around the same time, I moved hours and hours away. Aside from my girlfriend (now wife) that I moved to be with, I had zero friends, zero support system, and zero ties to any other church or community. So when the Mormons came a knockin', they were so friendly, had so many good things to say about their church, it was different enough from my old church that I thought, maybe, just maybe there is a God, and I was just in the wrong church before. They promised friendship, community, fellowship, a \"family\" when I had none (at least nearby). Suffice to say, like many converts, they just happened to get to me when I was in a vulnerable place in my life and it seemed like it would be a good thing.\n\nThe problem being, of course, that they spoon feed you information, and you don't fully realize what you have gotten yourself into until after you've already made a commitment, and additionally have been convinced that it's all real. So by the time you learn about the polygamy, racism, sexism, child abuse, weird doctrine, temple handshakes, magic underwear,  afterlife consisting of constantly impregnating your spirit wife (or wives) so she can constantly bear spirit children to populate your own kingdom (they deny ever saying planet, but it's just semantics), you are already invested spiritually, financially, time commitment-wise, family-wise, community-wise, etc. By that point you are balls deep, and even if you start to realize it's bullshit, if you leave you can be seriously screwed over (risk your marriage, lose your \"friends\", family and community may shun you, etc.). Anyway, it took years but I came to grips with leaving, I was lucky that my wife felt the same way and we realized before forcing our kids into baptism. I kept researching religion, listening to the experiences of others, and firmly landed in the atheist camp.\n\nTLDR; The church takes advantage of people in vulnerable situations who are more susceptible to their influence in difficult times."}

Which is something I'm not willing to condone. \n\nAnd no, it doesn't take giving free passes to Islam in order to focus on issues with Christians in America.

We all know that society has decided that a clump of cells isn't a person.\n\nThat's an arbitrary decision we've made. At what point a clump of cells gains personhood and becomes an autonomous person with rights is not a question science can answer. We're ALL clumps of cells.\n\nNow, that argument has lots of holes, such as IVF. IVF fertilizes thousands of eggs in the hopes that one will implant. Does each of these zygotes now have personhood? Is that now mass murder?\n\n\nThe above was salient point made by a deleted comment. \n\n\nProtestant American pro-lifers are not that intelligent and are way too pro-bourgeous to think about ivf. \n\n Catholics ones are opposed. \n\nSecular pro-lifers, it depends on their reasoning to be against abortion.

{"text":"While I could sympathize with that position, I find there is lack of drive or desire to explore why that is the best of of bad choices,and to completely annihilate the causes of that being the best of bad choices. \n\nWhen a significant amount of women are having abortions because of fiscal related decisions or career oriented ones, that's not a libertarian free willade choice. \n\nThat's coerced by the capitalists machine. \n\nUnless these lightly pro-choicers, as well as the pro-life movement is willing to dismantle to brutal reality the capitalist machine has constructed that cruelly puts women in the position to have to make this decision, they are not committed enough to making abortion rare. \n\nSex ed and contraception is less then the bare minimum. And  even the most liberal areas sex ed is godawful."}
{"text":"People who believe that abortion is literally murder are not going to be persuaded by \"it's my body\" type of rhetoric. And frankly, why should they? There is clearly the body of another human being being grown inside your body. The baby's body is connected to you, but is not just \"your\" body.\n\nNobody would look at a parasitic worm or a bacteria living in their intestines, or a maggot crawling in their open wound, and say \"that's inside me, therefore it is my body\", but they look at a fetus growing in their womb and say it. Why?\n\nIn my opinion, people who support abortion need to come to terms with the fact that a fetus clearly becomes another human being sometime before the baby actually comes out of the womb. After all, a fetus surgically removed from the mother earlier than 9 months can often live on its own and develop normally. This is clearly evidence that \"humanity\" of the fetus is achieved before the moment of birth.\n\nPersonally as a moderate on this issue, who thinks that fetuses obviously become human sometime during pregnancy but not instantly upon conception, I think the most reasonable abortion legality is something like this:\n\n1st term: Abortions for any reason.\n\n2nd term: Abortions if there is a serious medical reason to do so, ie developmental problems with the fetus.\n\n3rd term: Abortions only if the pregnancy seriously threatens the health of the mother."}

Then you got latest fiasco of Taliban, who would raid small villages to take hostages and force them into their religion(Islam), if not you were beheaded, thrown from a building, hung, or thrown rocks at.\n\nThere's also the ISIS outbreak in many parts of the world that force people to join them or be killed.  You ever seen people hung by their feet, their necks slit open and left to bleed in a factory?  I have.  It's not pretty, and ISIS loves to make a show of killing their enemy.  Drowning them, setting them on fire.

The fact that politicians let it creep into that, is silly.\n\nIslam is not a danger because it is still a very small demographic in the USA.  Look everywhere else that has a huge influx of Islam immigrants.  You have dedicated areas where a normal person can't go, where they cannot drink because it offends Muslims.  Where women should not go because it'll offend the 'exrremist' Muslims because of, their religion.  They hold massive gatherings to get more input into politics to force ways of their religion to be respected.\n\nYou see it quite a lot in England and other parts of Europe with a large population of immigrants.\n\nThis whole 'christianity' being a huge danger is a joke, just like 'white supremacy' being the worst thing for America like pedo Biden has stated.

They secure what's essentially a monopoly, then bang they start censoring everyone they disagree with.  Then Parler, Gab etc pop up to compete with them then bam, they are banned from all app stores.\n\nThis is the 1800s equivalent of creating a newspaper, establishing a monopoly, or network of monopolies, then burning every other competing paper and their building to the ground,  and putting pressure on companies to not let them rebuild and the post office to not deliver their papers.  But I suspect this is what you want, as rather than having a discussion or argument, you would much rather just block and ignore it. Leave it to big brother to decide for me.

Just the actions of sexual intimacy outside of marriage, but like I said, that applies to heterosexual people as well. Unfortunately, many Christians take verses out of context to be hateful toward the gay community. \nThe priests\/pastors who commit rape against children or anyone else should be kicked out of the priesthood\/church (as well as those who cover it up), and any Catholic who defends their actions should also leave the church. This teacher getting fired for having a gay marriage has nothing to do with homophobia. Teachers get fired from Catholic schools all of the time for not setting an proper example."}

Default state is when the flesh dies, the soul is outta luck. God, through Jesus, presents us with the option to accept help and have the soul be saved rather than snuffed out when the flesh dies. \n\n\nI suppose yeah, it is harsh. But the framing is important. It's more like, here's the deal, he created all this whether we like it or not. We can choose to be let into heaven on his terms if we want. It's about being willing to accept the way out. \n\n\nJust so you know, most of the time when Jesus talks about judgment day his imagery or parables describe something more akin to the unsaved souls being destroyed or burnt up or tossed out, not necessarily being eternally tormented. Something worth looking into. A lot of widely held western understandings of the Bible are rather off base from the actual text."}

(One of these admits to the society at large needing better education in the face of potentially bigoted misunderstandings ... )\"*\n\nI think we can agree that confusing \"Allah\" as being a different god from the singular \"Abrahamic god\" is an incorrect position, and is a commonly held belief amongst those who are not educated on the nuances of those religions (I think it's important to do from an atheist-agnostic perspective). As mentioned in the above quote, I do feel it's a failing of education as a whole, and is *indicative* of the bigotry that pervades society as a literal whole. \n\nAnd, to digress from that yet again, the whole point of that observation above is to drill into, and to clarify, why something is \"insulting\" to the populace, to which I'll continue below...\n\n&gt; Why do you keep trying to put this on an emotional scale.\n\nBecause I am following your original framing, quote you: \"You can't expect people to be happy if people come and use a different language that the de facto one. It's rude, and creates an unnecessary barrier. Yes, it would be rude to ask to do the pledge in Spanish.\" I interpreted this entire statement as an argument focused around how others would feel about the overall concern at hand. If that was not your case, I need that clarified and I'll happily re-frame.\n\n&gt; Don't you think your constant referring to those emotions is on a regressive trend\n\nGiven my above explanation, no. I'm merely working within the framework you laid out, as mentioned above. If I did not do this, I would fail in my attempt to give your position the benefit of the doubt.\n\n&gt; She is distancing herself from the rest, on an occasion where she could have chosen not to, by using the word that the rest of the country uses. This can be criticized.\n\nAgreed. I disagree with criticisms specifically targeting \"patriotism\", or that this is somehow an example of someone failing to be a good, American citizen.\n\n&gt; This \"this is the same god\" followed by accusation of ignroance and\/or stupidity is a classic of american rhetoric of left-wing bigots\n\nAnd you lost me. What?\n\n&gt;  Coming from atheists, it's particularly depressing.\n\nBecause a member of what you consider to be a part of your \"in-group\" can have an intellectual disagreement?\n\n&gt; The god of the quran and hadiths keeps talking shit about christians and jews and will send them to hell. The trees he created will even denounce the jews hiding behind them when the end of tmes come. The god of the christians does not send all christians to hell. You could say \"they are the same god\", but then this god is very schizophrenic indeed. \n\nI mean, if you're expecting religious text to be anything but schizophrenic... \n\nSorry, I have to stop this again. You do understand that my original question in previous posts were asking about what could be possible causes for the reaction to a tradition-breaking statement, right (i.e. is it strictly religious, is it because of the language used, is it both and\/or more)? All of that was my attempt, made in a good-faith, to clarify and better understand your point. So this rebuttal seems misplaced because I think we began to talk past each other and missing the intent of the question to begin with. \n\n&gt; If a white christian had said \"God\" or \"Jehovah\" or what not in an arab discourse in a similar but inverted situation, everybody here would be shitting on them. But the politics of the US have become so black and white that their hatred of what is perceived to be \"the other side\" is stronger than the rational thought many people here pretend to have. Often mocking the religious people's lack thereof.\n\nSo you definitely feel strongly that this is flying in the face of religious citizens who conflate patriotism with religious adherence, and likewise, it can also be because of the specific religious connotations behind the specific word choice, and less about the deviation away from the lingua franca?\n\n&gt;  The god of the quran and hadiths keeps talking shit about christians and jews and will send them to hell. The trees he created will even denounce the jews hiding behind them when the end of tmes come. The god of the christians does not send all christians to hell. You could say \"they are the same god\", but then this god is very schizophrenic indeed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Islam borrows heavily from Zoroastrinism; are Allah and Ahura Mazda the same god then? Since you think Allah and YHWH are the same god, are YWHW and Ahura Mazda the same god? For Christians, Jesus is God (as is the holy spirit). Is Jesus the same God as Allah? But in Islam, Jesus is a prophet and not a god? Bigoted misunderstandings?\n\n[What?](https:\/\/www.shitpostbot.com\/img\/sourceimages\/jackie-chan-smashed-face-5a6513807efca.jpeg) Do you want me to answer that in earnest? Are you confused on something in particular, or are you trying to (potentially) imply that it cannot be a religious issue because there is no way Americans would take using \"under Allah\" as an offensive statement?\n\n&gt; I am 100% for removing all the godly shit in the pledges, bills and whatnot. But it being there, she chose to not pledge with the common word that people in this country use for god, she wilingly chose to use one in another language. She is the one who, by this choice, is ostensibly signifying that her god is different.\n\nOkay we're back on track, thank you. I believe it is a valid analysis; that perhaps she is saying her god is different, and that would clarify my previous questions. Perhaps even that you feel this is insulting to (please choose a better word for me and correct me if this does not fit your thought) the tradition-focused Americans and that this makes her \"unpatriotic\" (as much as I disagree with that having anything to do with patriotism).\n\n&gt; If a white christian had said \"God\" or \"Jehovah\" or what not in an arab discourse in a similar but inverted situation, everybody here would be shitting on them. But the politics of the US have become so black and white that their hatred of what is perceived to be \"the other side\" is stronger than the rational thought many people here pretend to have. Often mocking the religious people's lack thereof.\n\nSo you definitely feel strongly that this is flying in the face of religious citizens who conflate patriotism with religious adherence, and likewise, it can also be because of the specific religious connotations behind the specific word choice, and less about the deviation away from the lingua franca?"}

That's the entire current claim.

If you had devoted all this time in your life to something in reality like a science, with this same zeal and passion and understanding... you might have actually made a change in the world to actually help people. \n\nBut instead you have wasted your life on fake bull shat and its not your fault, you were probably indoctrinated into it before you could even walk and brainwashed since with a heavy dose of ignoring your early proper education (or were you home schooled?).\n\nWhen you lay on your death bed and 80 years have gone by without the rapture they kept telling you would happen your whole life (my evangelical in laws have been telling me the rapture is coming any day for 30 years) ... and you look back and realize that it was all fake... no god ever spoke with you, interacted with you... you wasted your time and life on nothing... you will have wished you had actually LIVED your life and accomplished something real out of this fantasy bubble you have existed in.\n\nIt is pity I feel for you and after there is clearly no hope for you. Such a waist of existence. FREE YOURSELF.\n\n\n\"It does not do well to dwell on dreams and forget to live.\" Harry Potter"}

{"text":"This was originally a topic about echo-chambers and circle-jerks, however, well since you wish to devolve into that topic sexism further...\n\nLets see.. Your premise that feminism is an equality movement is also questionable. It can easily be perceived as a superiority movement. I bring your attention to the #killAllMen movement. \n\nThere is nothing equal about that. Fair enough I moved the topic slightly but it was only to disprove the logic of your statement. MensRight defines *itself* as an equality movement as does feminism.  The problem is the definitions come from inside each respective movement. I can call myself anything I like, But as you so aptly put it, it doesn't make a penguin a vegetable. Now I am not sitting here saying MensRights is an equality movement, just that they *claim* it is, the same as with feminism. \n\nTwo. Anecdotal evidence is irrelevant. I can sit here and cite plenty of encounters I've had with feminists who were also complete shitbags and worse (See the above reference to #KillAllMen) that are nothing more than raging right-wing psychopaths. Do I paint the whole community as such because of the actions of the obnioxious extreme elements? No. Many I have met are reasonable intelligent human beings, some misguided, some genuinely seeking equality.  \n\nThe problem with your position is you do not allow yourself to consider the possibility you may be wrong. You are so *certain* in the fact that feminism is an *equality* movement it stains all further arguments based on that premise.\n\nHere are some questions to challenge your viewpoint. I do hope you actually consider them as phrased.\n\n* Does feminism support males having \"equal\" custody rights to children after a separation? or does it seek to ensure females gain as much custody as possible?\n\n* Does feminism support male participation in, and advancement in Female heavy industries like child-care, HR and early education?\n\n* Does feminism provide support to male victims of domestic violence to escape their living situations and find shelter?\n\n* Does feminism support females being included in the military draft?\n\n\n\nIf the answer is no to any of these questions then it does not support equality. It puts the needs and wants of one group above another.\n\nMensRight does not claim to do any of this for females hence why I do not consider them an equality movement. They are focused squarely on advancing the agendas of males. I argue feminism is the same only for females."}
{"text":"&gt; Fighting for equality between the sexes means more rights for women because they currently and historically have had fewer. \n\nI do not fully disagree here. However, It does not mean the rights of men should be ignored when injustice and inequality is identified to swing the other way.\n\n&gt; This battle against the oppressive patriarchy and gender roles benefits both sexes. Attacking the idea that women are weak and emotional while men must be strong or detached means that boys should be allowed to cry and experience healthy emotions.\n\nWhy are you gaslighting and changing the topic?, we were not discussing this. \nI never once mentioned women are weak and emotional, nor did I state men are supposed to be strong and detached. This is quite disingenuous of you and hardly lends to your argument.\n\n&gt; If society should accept that women can be dominant in a relationship, it eases the expectation for guys to make the first move, which can be very overwhelming for many. If women aren\u2019t considered inherently softer and more motherly, courts will be less likely to default to assuming that women are better caregivers, making custody battles easier for men. \n\nAgain you are diverting form the topic. specific Feminist strategy for a single issue (child custody) is not the topic.

But by doing so they are choosing which aspects of Islam to adhere to and which to ignore.  As such they are believing that everything about Islam is true except for those bits that they cannot follow and still be decent people.  They still adhere to beliefs they would not otherwise have, and their thoughts and behavior influenced accordingly.  They will have that tendency to believe without proof, and perpetuate their religion, even if they don't follow the whole thing.\n\nThe same applies to any given religion.  That's the problem that causes archaic ideas to have hold in an otherwise decent and rational society.

{"text":"At what point have I made that comparison? I haven't even implied it, all I've stated is about you feeling like you're getting poked with pitchforks. You're the one offering that comparison.\n\nEveryone treats transgender youth affirming care as an easy thing to obtain, when in most cases it takes a year or two of frequent visits with a professional to diagnose correctly and for treatment. Puberty blockers are to pause puberty so the child can make a more informed decision about HRT at a later age (usually 16). These therapies are done usually via affirmative care which follows the child's needs without leading them towards that direction. No one has objected to puberty blocker against cis kids with precocious puberty (ie the reason why this med exists for this use), but with trans people, it's objected against.\n\nThe issue with folks who are nervous about these things, is that often times they're the ones who know very little from the health care that is provided and accepted upon. Many of these things have been posited and thought about from the people who treat trans folk, and take great care to make sure everything is done correctly for the well being of the child. And in no way blocking avenues for treatment makes it any better.\n\nIn the same way that a cis person going through cross sex hormone treatment would be traumatizing, it goes the same way as a trans person going through their own irreversible puberty. Every adult trans person was once a trans child, who either didn't know, by being uninformed, or was prevented treatment or was scared of harm from their own social environment.\n\nRegarding yourself, your treatment from other may lie in that you've provided no sources, and no, the story about Dr. Zucker isn't one, and how you jump from one topic to another.

The things I have mentioned have had successes and they absolutely do have evidence to support them as ways to deal with these issues and people. \n\nBut go ahead... advocate for locking them all up forever... good luck with that. Again, I'm a pragmatist. If this is how you want to engage, then I guess if you really want to mostly eliminate it, keep all men with children in their families locked up forever because most of these crimes are committed by male family and close male acquaintances. And then go ahead and lock up any child who is abused because sometimes they go on to abuse themselves and in fact most people who abuse were victims first. Done. Problem solved I guess."}

And one of those identity markers used to explicitly state American identity was belief in God.\n\nBut I guess that history isn't God-hatey enough for respect on r\/atheism. :P"}

Getting \"everybody(tm)\" to vote isn't really the way forward.  People away from Trumpism way overestimated the intelligence and disposition of the non voting population.

Why would powerful people want to keep things how they are?  Because they're already powerful and want to maintain that power.  Pretty simple.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; So when a party that used to promise \"a steady hand to keep things how  they are\" has descended further and further into insanity over the  course of several decades, and now is openly hostile to expertise, to  solutions, to stability...of course the powerful people are going to  leave. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou would think that from the word \"conservative.\" But it is not true.

There's no reason that \"Nigger\" for instance, need have any more meaning attached to it than \"black\". It's not an inherent part of the word, it's meaning comes from our emotional response to it. Daigo targets italians but no one really gets offended by that while it still falls into the definition of slur. \"Fuck\" is the bad version of \"Sex\" solely because we choose to believe that it is bad and now that we as a society are saying, \"nah, it's fine, sex isn't shameful\" it doesn't have that power. We're all just products of our society and American society is incredibly sensitive about Race at the moment (and rightfully so!) and so slurs have power as this super high intensity emotional part of our society."}

{"text":"&gt;40 hour work weeks aren\u2019t what allows you to have access to 21st standards of living.\n\n*Other people's* 40 hour work weeks are absolutely where your 21st century standard of living comes from. Food ends up on your table because farmers grow it, truckers haul it, and grocery stores stock it. At every single step of this chain, people not showing up to work results in food not appearing on your table. The computer you're typing on exists because a whole lot of people at Intel spend their 40 hours turning sand into microchips. Those people not showing up to work results in computers not appearing in your local Apple store. You can connect to the internet because people spend their 40 hours running fiber optic cables across continents and oceans. Those people not showing up to work results in me, currently in Japan for work, not being able to communicate with Reddit's servers in the United States.\n\nThe antiwork communist crowd seem to think that all of the things they enjoy appear magically out of thin air, and that working for a living is some sort of elite conspiracy to oppress you. The reality is that the standard of living you enjoy is the product of unimaginable amounts of constant human effort, and the idea that we could somehow stop doing it, but still enjoy that standard of living, is preposterous.\n\n&gt;You pay taxes and you Exist, you are entitled to be treated exactly like anybody else.\n\nYou certainly are entitled.\n\n&gt;Just cause you\u2019ve never even considered a system where people aren\u2019t taken advantage of\n\nI'm not being taken advantage of. I work for a living, and in return I get to benefit from the efforts of other people who work for a living. It's a win-win. We both spend our time improving the world, and we both get to benefit from the improvements we've made to the world.\n\nYou're the one who wants to take advantage of the people who produce the standard of living you enjoy, by not being willing to contribute to it yourself.\n\n&gt;I\u2019m not sure what cognitive deficiency you have to have to hold the belief that the only people who deserve high standards of living are those selling their souls to a fucking job.\n\nIt's the cognitive deficiency where I understand that the world doesn't owe me for existing.

I can perhaps agree that there are a pretty good number of jobs that don't actually produce anything valuable, and could pretty safely be cut back or eliminated without actually hurting anything. This says a lot more about the useless nature of those particular jobs than it says about the economy as a whole.\n\nMost of us go into work and we actually produce something. Our labor produces an actual product, and if we put in less labor, less of that product is produced. It's utter foolishness to act as if the useless nature of white collar paper-pushing is somehow indicative of the idea that I could cut my job, where I actually produce things, without affecting the rate at which I can produce them. If you believe this, you're either one of those useless white collar paper-pushers, in which case you're unqualified to comment on the work of those of us who are actually productive, or you're a teenager who's never actually held down a real job, in which case you're also unqualified to comment on the work of those of us who are actually productive."}

They have a strong military, the second strongest in the world - nowhere near stronger than the obscenity that is the American military, but certainly an order of magnitude stronger than anything America has fought in the past century apart from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan (not even a fair comparison, given how the advent of modern military technology would put the carnage of WWII to shame), and most definitely stronger than any of our allies. That\u2019s nearly 1,000,000 active personnel, and more than twice that in known reservists, all of whom are likely to sober up real fucking fast when they find out their homeland is being invaded by the Americans.\n\nThey have submarines, actual warships, air support, dogfighters, and, I really, really cannot stress enough, *INTERCONTINENTAL NUCLEAR MISSILES*. The *second* largest arsenal of nuclear missiles *in the world*, surpassed *only* by the U.S.\n\nEnough with this hawkish foolishness.

Saying \"both sides\" or any argument predicated on it creates a distraction from the actual issue at hand, and gives a pass to the people who are doing the thing that's being talked about, because you're covering for them, *whether you intend to or not.*\n\n2. Trying to change the subject like you did to the offense of a bad actor more than four years ago who is no longer in power is exactly that kind of distraction, because it has nothing to do with what is happening right now. It aims to shift the conversation away from the ills of *the entire republican party, in the present* to the past and a smaller group, again, no longer in power.\n\n3. Trying to change the subject, like you did, also gives false equivalence to the actions and intents in question, which are not equivalent. Attempting to remove millions of Americans' right to vote in future general elections, and place the results of all future elections in doubt and in the hands of partisans, with the support and complicity of an entire party is vastly worse than a shitty person trying to keep a candidate from winning a primary (which is not protected by the constitution) and subsequently being rejected by her party and booted from her leadership role.\n\n4. The false equivalence you draw with merely the suggestion, let alone insistence, that these are equal, gives a pass to the people who are doing the greater and more immediate wrong by diverting attention and suggesting that there is some normalcy to it. This blunts the outrage that should be directed at the people currently doing the wrong. It doesn't matter if this is what you're trying to do, it's what happens.\n\nSo, if you're *not* trying to distract, and you're *not* on board with the undermining of American democracy that is going on *right now*, stop accidentally helping the Republicans with distractions and whataboutism, and focus on issues that are currently relevant. We can shit on DWS and the Democratic party when this is fixed.\n\nIf you *are* trying to distract in order to give them Republicans some cover in the public discourse, then just admit it, and then fuck yourself."}

And now you're going to be illegal, too. And you're going to go wherever they send you.\n\nI mean, how much could I be expected to argue? Due to their actions, I was illegally trapped in China, largely unable to communicate with people back home because I couldn't use my phone and most ways of communicating via the internet were blocked. Astoundingly, at the time, I could use reddit. Which is where I learned about chabuduo and realized it explained a lot about my situation.

Just a frightening situation where everything was bad and my communication was cut off and no one would help.\n\nI've been through a few bad things in my life, like my childhood home burning down, or having a medical emergency.

You've argued that they are wrong, which is not the same as *lying.*\n\n&gt; &gt; they're responding to a claim that black people are more likely to be killed by the police\n\n&gt; Which isn't true.\n\nIt is, and you've agreed that it is. It only isn't if you rephrase the sentence to carefully exclude any factor other than the cops literally hating black people.\n\n&gt; &gt; so they can't have started the cycle of black people being less likely to cooperate with the police.\n\n&gt; That's the culture. They simply added to it.\n\nThen that's not answering the question, which was: What started the cycle?\n\n&gt; Then you're the outlier.\n\nReally don't think I am. Otherwise, how *do* you explain this idea becoming popular? Is every white person who accepts this claim secretly thinking \"Well, *my* parents taught me this stuff, but I must be the outlier\"?\n\n&gt; And you believe there's enough of this happening in to cause the 5.9 million single mothers?\n\nI believe this is one thing you have to rule out, among many, before concluding it must be culture. You said \"What else could it be?\" instead of providing an argument that it definitely must be culture. Ruling out every possible systemic cause is going to take a bit more work.\n\nMeanwhile, there are 7.3 million hispanic and 8.4 million white single mothers. 5.9 is disproportionate, but how many of those do we need to explain?\n\n---\n\n&gt; They clearly do. Your own link says that at most it will cost $175 and that's only if they don't have their birth certificate or other identifying documents.\n\nSo you're cool with a poll tax of $175?\n\n&gt; Their own source shows that their claims about this don't apply to all of them either.\n\nBut again, shouldn't a single disenfranchised voter count?\n\n&gt; &gt; So no, it doesn't show that people who don't get ID don't vote.\n\n&gt; I never said it said that.\n\nHere is what you said:\n\n&gt; The most recent studies show that voter ID laws don't produce a lower turnout among any groups. Turns out that the people who refuse to get an ID for whatever reason, also don't register to vote.\n\nYour source doesn't support *either* of those things. Even if you backpedal to saying you didn't say your source said those things, why link it at all, then, and what *is* your source for that claim?\n\n&gt; Fear of being caught is only a thing if there is a reasonably high risk of that. There isn't.\n\nThere is.\n\n&gt; &gt; The data is the number of double-vote attempts caught.\n\n&gt; You can't prove a negative.\n\nAn oversimplification. I can't *prove* that the moon landing *wasn't* faked, but I can point to the evidence we would expect to see if it was: Either much more obvious problems with the footage, or someone leaking the secret decades-ahead-of-the-tech-industry Kubrickian CGI factory.\n\nAlso, this one goes both ways. You claim voter ID laws are worthwhile. Your claim requires that we also prove how much undetected voter fraud happens *with* voter ID.\n\n&gt; &gt; ...you're going to get arrested for threatening a poll worker.\n\n&gt; Not if that poll worker is breaking the law.\n\nDoesn't matter. You're not a cop, and this isn't the kind of thing you're allowed to respond to with deadly force. This is why you either call the cops or fight it in court.\n\nOtherwise, it'd be 100% legal to shoot a cop who's racially profiled you.\n\n&gt; &gt; Looking at a photo isn't the only way to verify an identity.\n\n&gt; How do you verify that the person you're talking to matches the information they gave?\n\nIn this case, providing enough relevant information is usually good enough. Have you never filed anything online?\n\n&gt; &gt; Name, DOB, SSN, they took a ton of information.\n\n&gt; And without a photo ID there is no proof that those actually belong to you.\n\n*With* a photo ID there is no proof I haven't forged that ID, or bribed a DMV worker. But it turns out it is actually difficult to get all that information in the same place, otherwise identity theft would be much more common.\n\n&gt; I'm a landlord. Yes we do. Here's the form showing the information I need to file for an eviction.\n\nHmm... I see a section for \"Defendant's Information\" which says \"if known\", and no reason I couldn't put N\/A there for someone who didn't have a driver's license. And... that's it -- the rest is DOB, SSN, phone number, address, plus a bunch of notary stuff about *you* being the person you say you are, and declaring under penalty of perjury that this is all true.\n\nNowhere does it say you need to have seen this person's driver's license in person.\n\n&gt; &gt; Source: Breitbart? Really?\n\n&gt; No.\n\nAn interesting result there: Only 39% believe mail-in voting led to fraud. What's going on with the (according to this site) 35% of voters who think mail-in voting didn't lead to massive fraud, and yet we should have to show someone a photo ID?\n\n&gt; Let's say the wrong person votes as soon as the pools open. The right person comes by and tries to vote later. Somehow they get everything figured out and let him vote. How do they track and arrest the first person?\n\nGood question. But if this were widespread, wouldn't we see tons of investigations into that first person? Or both of them?\n\nAlso, doesn't really work with your drive-around-and-hit-a-bunch-of-polls plan. Now you get maybe one or two extra votes per person who does this, before it starts getting too risky. And even \"as soon as the polls open\" risks a mail-in ballot beating yours.\n\n---\n\n&gt; The founding of a nation is defined as when that nation becomes separate from all other nations.\n\nSemantics. Now you're backing away from your snippy \"based on a lie\" rhetoric, and into \"Well, they used the wrong definition.\"\n\n&gt; The claim is that the laws still exist to enforce white supremacy.\n\nThe claim is that they still *do* enforce white supremacy, and that at least some were enacted in order to enforce white supremacy.\n\nThere's no claim that modern-day judges and police are secretly klansmen, the claim is that they perpetuate a system that, possibly invisibly to them, is still disproportionately bad for black people.\n\nI'm still annoyed I had to go check that one, but there's hardly any mention of \"white supremacy\" by name in the whole thing.\n\n---\n\n&gt; You're the one introducing the criteria that past actions need to be judged on a current understanding of the ideas surrounding those actions. By that exact logic, we have to consider how people in the future may change the definitions of things also.\n\nWe agree that scientific understanding changes -- the heliocentrists were *incorrect.* The world isn't flat, and it goes around the sun. But wait, am I allowed to say that, or do I have to refrain from making any such definitive statements because future scientists might find out something new?\n\n---\n\n&gt; &gt; All judicial abuses matter?\n\n&gt; Of course.\n\nOr, to be blunt: All lives matter? You're really going to defend that?\n\n&gt; The same people who elected and allowed the current judge to remain will be the same people electing the new judge.\n\nSo: Do those people elect this judge because they were racists who thought she'd agree with their racists views, and then allowed her to stay because of how she handled this situation? Or is it possible they *don't* think she's a racist, or allowed her to stay *despite* how she handled this situation?\n\nThe probability that they'll select a less-racist replacement isn't high, but it's higher than zero. So the probability that you end up with a racist judge after replacing this one is high, but it's lower than the probability you end up with a racist judge if you *don't* replace her.\n\n&gt; You're putting a band aid on it to provide a temporary solution that could easily lead to the same thing happening again. I want a more permanent solution.\n\nBand aids are better than letting a wound get infected while you wait for a more permanent solution. I'm sure those kids would've *loved* a \"band aid\"."}

You use that to form a prediction, and if it works out, you have proof of a thing not being true.  That's really more of a math thing, but you can do it in physical sciences too.\n\nFaith is what you have when you have no proof either way, but insist a thing is true anyway.  There is no way to prove faith, because if there were, you would have _evidence_.\n\nReligion is faith.  That doesn't make it not true, but it doesn't make it proven or real either.  You can't prove a thing you take on faith.\n\n&gt; They responded like a 15 year old just discovering r\/ atheism\n\nAnd you've been responding like you're taking personal offence to someone implying the Christian God isn't real.  That poster is at least in their 20s, appears to be married for some time, and has a kid.  (Or they're making that up, but I'll _take it on faith_ that they aren't.)"}

{"text":"No kidding. I don't have insurance because the costs were around $600 a month with a deductible of $3,500 and a max out-of-pocket around $8k. The premiums alone were a quarter of my monthly take home! Last week was the first time I actually needed it after dropping my coverage in 2017. I cut my hand pretty severely with an electric hedge trimmer; my first thought about getting care was to try an urgent care facility, but as this happened at around 8PM on a Sunday, no urgent care was open within a 20 mile radius of me and I was bleeding far too much to feel comfortable driving that far. My only option was going to the ER. They saw me very quickly after the intake paperwork was filled out, I'm sure due to the fact that I was leaking crimson all over the waiting room. I ended up needing 10 stitches and a prescription for antibiotics (in case of infection; my wound and I were very dirty from the yardwork) and was billed almost $2,500! Thus far I've refused to pay it; I'm negotiating with their billing department for a much lower, less completely outrageous price. \n\nInsurance in this country is a fucking racket. A goddamn shakedown on the national level, and we're all getting fucked by it. I've hated the way things are since I first learned that people all over the country were going bankrupt for finding themselves with a serious illness way back when I was a teenager in 2000. It's absolutely abhorrent that our government decided that healthcare for its people isn't something that they're willing to pay for with *our tax money*, but that no price is too high to pay to blow up civilians halfway across the world on the off chance that they'll also kill a \"terrorist leader\" hiding on a school bus or attending a wedding. Every other \"western\" country has healthcare for it's people (not to mention worker protections that seem like a goddamn dream come true to anyone who's ever been fired because it's cheaper to train a new guy at starting wages than continue paying an experienced employee). It's disgusting that some people still dare to call this the greatest country on earth despite the fact that our government would rather let its citizens die or go bankrupt *and then* die instead of funding any kind of meaningful universal care. They would rather continue allowing us to lose every cent to our family's names to keep our loved ones alive, bleeding us dry into the pockets of insurance companies. I wish I could ask the powers that be why they think it's acceptable for an industry to happily take people's money month after month, ostensibly in order to cover the costs of care that every one will eventually need, but always do all in their power to avoid paying out a single cent to their customers when they need it, and why they're ok letting those companies decide who lives and who dies based on their purse strings. Why is our government so afraid of the insurance industry that they let them be the arbiters of all of our lives? Obviously because congressmen and senators have their campaigns heavily funded by these companies and won't bite the hand that feeds them, but the real question is how do we put an end to this parasitic relationship? How do we kill the insurance industry? Better yet, how do we kill the insurance industry without the cooperation of the right?\n\nEdit: whoever replied to me about \"looking into my state's medical debt...\" your reply doesn't appear in the comment chain.

{"text":"&gt;The Nazis were Socialist. We can see that with their universal healthcare, strong unions, and the welfare state. Hitler himself would fit in with the socialists of today. As he was a vegan dog lover who talked about the dangers of cigarettes. \n\nFalse. Ernst Rohm who probably saw to it the closest image of actual socialism was murdered along with many others in the Night of the Long Knives. Literally no respectable historian will label Nazis \"socialists\" remotely close to the leftist movements of today. Even venturing on Wikipedia and observing the underlying ideologies of the Nazi Party does not list Socialism; it lists **nationalism**; it lists **fascism**. These are inherently right-wing ideological groups.\n\nI mean, golly, for being socialists, they sure hated Socialists, Social Democrats, and Communists\u2014huh? Why didn't such parties flock to them or caucus? Oh right, because they espoused something much different by way of ratial hierarchy and authoritarian-rule. You see the key piece you're missing in all this is that Nazi Germany was anything but a legitimate Democracy akin to calling North Korea a People's Republic. At that point you forego the term, \"socialist,\" because it's not inherently \"controlled by the people.\" Those unions you mentioned? They were controlled by the party apparatus that was totalitarian rule\u2014*not* a healthy, functioning Democracy.\n\nThough I do find it amusing because one of the remnants of the Nazis that was rebuilt and pushed forward beyond the 40s was their health-care system. This alone is not enough to call them \"socialist,\" however. \n\n- Nazis **were NOT** left-wing socialists. (they actually banned the primary Social Democratic party). Again, say it with me: They were right-wing fascist authoritarian nationalists.\n\n- Hitler loosened gun control laws over time\u2014especially for members of the Nazi party. Most historians agree that guns wouldn't have made a difference to rebels since by the time the degree of oppression was felt, most Germans were duped into the propaganda and onboard. \n\n- I repeat: Numerous holocaust survivors and the **last-surviving Nuremberg prosecutor who saw action on Normandy beach** agree that there are noteworthy parallels between Trump &amp; Republicans and the Nazis. Godwin, himself, said it is permissible to use Godwin's Law in context to Trump.\n\n- Early stages of Nazi rise to power sought dominion over the news. By 1934 they had banned 1,600 newspapers, banned outside news like the BBC, and pivoted towards pro-Nazi news. Anything critical of the regime was considered **L\u00fcgenpresse**\u2014Lying Press... Sound familiar...? The point is that gas-chambers didn't suddenly pop up overnight; instead it was a steady degradation of liberties and and an increasing tension where if you tried to resistance the current of ignorance, you'd be quickly put down.\n\n\n&gt;AOC literally wanted to make a list of political rivals. She's the worst example for your case.\n\nAnd do what? LMAO. We knew the NRA and right-wing groups have had such lists already. If you think AOC is in any way remotely comparable to the power Hitler at in the early 30s and in the events preceding the Night of Long Knives, you need to re-take history.\n\n&gt;You mean like how the left calls everyone a Nazi, Trump supporter etc? To the point where they are wrong, such as yourself? \n\nThe problem is you don't actually cleanse your banner of these people. You either actively or passively endorse them behind closed-doors. The problem is you won't disavow the actions of those most extreme among your ranks. And when I point out that the vast-majority of political violence and especially murder is wrought from the Right, including but not limited to conspiring to kidnap democratically-elected governors (much nationalism, huh), storming the capitol and committing insurrection as you literally beat the cops you so pretend to care about with a flag-pole (there's some symbolism for you)... I just have to wonder what goes through your head to settle this profound degree of cognitive dissonance. I mean the FBI and DHS agree with me: your ideology is a threat. The left are nowhere remotely comparable. So if you had to take a guess at who would be most likely to mimic the violence and jump onboard with Nazism, I'd reckon it's someone like you: insecure, statistically-uneducated, looking for scapegoats for your shallow self-esteem, and looking for something to be prideful in. [Here, watch this](https:\/\/youtu.be\/jcGi4maiJW8). \n\nIt really comes as no surprise, considering evidence for the ideological divide resides in the lack of empathy on the right side of the political spectrum; and without empathy, you are doomed to repeat the mistakes of history.\n\nEven more so, I could very well be talking to a Nazi who embraces all these things but is too much of a coward to outright admit it\u2014seeing how law-enforcement highlighted a pivot in strategy for these extremist groups. \n\nA lot of your arguments are just such lazy thinking to the point I believe you're arguing in bad-faith. I mean, to the notion of controlled-mass media, you try to isolate Fox; but the problem is clearly much wider than that.

{"text":"&gt;The parties switched. It's well-recorded.\n\nYou're right. It is.\n\nThe Democratic Party started in the 1820s. Right away, it switched sides, as we can see from the fact that they pushed for the removal and extermination of Indians. Also, their opposition was the Whig party, which was against the Indian Removal Act and vowed to protect minorities against mob rule. Because the sides were switched, the vast majority of Whig party were anti-slavery.\n\n(Eventually, there was rift in the party over the issue of slavery, and anti-slavery members of the Whig party, including Abraham Lincoln, exited the party and formed the Republican Party. As we can see, the parties must have switched again because it's common knowledge that Republicans are actually the racist ones.)\n\nThen the parties switched when the Democrats are on record as having mainly been the ones who owned slaves. Not all Democrats owned slaves, but 100% of slaves were owned by Democrats. Not a single Republican in history owned a slave. As we know, the parties switched again when Republicans repudiated slavery and Democrats defended it, leading to the civil war.\n\nThen the parties switched again when a Democrat assassinated Republican Lincoln.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the parties switched again during the Reconstruction Era, when Republicans attempted to pass a series of civil rights amendments in the late 1800s that would grant citizenship for freedmen. As evidence of the switch, the Democrats voted against giving former slaves citizenship, but the civil rights amendments passed anyway.\n\nThe parties switched again when the Democratic Party members founded the KKK as their military arm. Democrats then attempted to pass the first gun control law in order to keep blacks from having guns and retaliating against their former owners. A county wanted to make it illegal to possess firearms, unless you were on a horse. (Hmmm wonder who rode around on horses terrorizing people \ud83e\udd14). Gun control has always been a noble cause touted by Democrats, but the racist reasons why the concept of gun control was dreamed up was a part of a party mentality switch, but not the actual party.\n\nSomewhere around this time former slaves fought for gun rights for all, and the NRA was formed. The NRA switched parties too when they defended the right for blacks to arm themselves and white NRA members protected blacks from racist attackers.\n\nThe parties switched again when Republicans fought to desegregate schools and allow black children to attend school with white children, which Democrats fought fiercely against.\n\nThe nation saw a rash of black lynchings and bombings of black churches by the Democrats in the KKK and the parties switched again when Democrat Bull Conner tried to avoid prosecuting the racist bombers to get them off the hook. When blacks protested this injustice, the party-switched Democrat Bull Conner sicced dogs and turned the hose on them. He also gave police stand down orders when the KKK forewarned attacks on the freedom riders, who had switched parties.\n\nThe parties switched again when a Democratic Party president appointed the first and only KKK member to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe parties switched yet again when Democratic president FDR put Asians in racist internment camps.\n\nThen parties switched again when the Democrats filibustered the passing of the second set of civil rights laws giving equal protection to minorities.\n\nThe parties switched when a Democrat assassinated MLK.\n\nThis brings us to modern times. The parties continue to switch all the time.\n\nThe parties switched when Democrats proposed racist policies like affirmative action to limit opportunities for certain racial groups in order to grant privilege to other racial groups.\n\nThe parties switched when the Islamic fundamentalist Omar Mateen and several other ISIS mass shooters aligned themselves with Democratic candidates like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe parties switched again when liberal student groups in schools like UCLA and Berkeley call for segregated housing to make \"separate but equal\" housing quarters for black students. Actually this is a current ongoing thing, so the parties are right now in the middle of switching on this topic.\n\nParties always switched currently now that Democrats are rioting and violently protesting democracy.\n\nThe parties switched once more when the Democratic Nominee for President, an old white man, said \"you're not black\" if you don't vote for him, in a moment of clarity of how the Democratic Party sees their largest voter base: as property belonging to them.\n\nSo as you can see, because of Party switching, Democrats were always the ones who stood up against racism and wanted peace and unity while Republicans were always the racist and violent ones calling for division and discord.\n\ntl;dr: The Democrats have always been the party of race and party switch is a meme."}

Go read the fucking information. \n\n&gt;And? He was convicted of 2nd and 3rd degree murder (rightly so)\n\nYou claimed there was no charge of manslaughter. There was once again showing you are talking out of your ass. \n\n&gt;No it's not, nothing is going to change. \n\nSince you don't have any knowledge of it your opinion is noted and ignored.

It got quite heated but I was able to get down to the fundamental disagreement we had.  He believes humanity is essentially a cancer and needs to end.  According to him, all humans need to be forced into a communist society where all ability to cause harm is removed, human nature is suppressed, and those who don't follow the rules of the government must be killed.\n    \nHe sees humanity as a problem, and that everyone should effectively live in a sort of autopilot state, in fear of losing their government-handled needs to survive.\n    \nI can only assume he must suffer from a significant amount of self-hatred.  His fundamental beliefs are in exact opposition to mine, and are downright scary."}

{"text":"&gt;the other is a fringe reddit movement created in the last 3 years\n\nThe first incel forum and the term \"incel\" dates back to 1993, founded by a woman by the way. That much about blaming girls, right?\n\n&gt;Muslims are a heterogenous ethnic group comprising 2 billion people\n\nFirst of all, muslims aren't an *ethnic* group. Second, Incels naturally come from all over the planet and ethnic groups. Is that not a heterogenous group?\n\n&gt;the fact that you\u2019d even think about equating them for a \u2018clever\u2019 reddit comment is pretty disturbing and somewhat xenophobic for a people that have had to deal with much worse than \u2018not having a girlfriend\n\nIncels are based around not having a girlfriend. Muslims are based around the opportunity to achieve salvation. Seems like a better outlook to me. You probably think about muslims that are victims of terrorism and war. But that isn't because they're muslims, so, that comparison doesn't fit. Muslims get discriminated. That's a point. \n\n&gt;somewhat xenophobic\n\nI exactly made this comparison because I am not. I don't judge a group by the crimes of a few. So why would you?\n\n&gt;celibate\u2019? don\u2019t you want an accurate description?\n\n\"Celibacy\u00a0(from\u00a0Latin,\u00a0c\u00e6libatus\") is the state of voluntarily being unmarried,\u00a0sexually abstinent, or both\" \n\nSeems like the perfect description. I don't claim I'm not interested in sex too, but that alone doesn't interest me, otherwise I could just a prostitute. \n\n\n\n&gt;get some help.\n\nArrogant Statements like that don't lead to anything. You have no idea about my life besides the fact that I can't find a girlfriend. On what basis do you assume I need help, or that I don't already get it?"}
{"text":"It's obvious that the term \"Incel\" is an antithesis, yes. That doesn't make it an inaccurate term. Imagine being in celibacy, only involuntarily. There, that's what being an incel is. And according to that definition, someone who feels unloved is an incel. You're fixating on literal terms to make a point, but that doesn't add up, because I already told you what being an incel means *to me*. \n\n\n&gt;because the term makes no sense and perpetuates an identity of victim hood and tethers it to a lack of sex\n\nThe definition of celibacy also mentions the prohibition of relationsships, so if the term puts the focus on sex, that's your view and not what the word actually (was) is supposed to mean. And identity of victimhood? Yeah, that can be true. I also see myself as a victim to some degree. But I try to solve my problem nonetheless, so that isn't a reason for me to reject the term. \n\n&gt;which no one is entitled to in the first place, anyway\n\nI never claimed otherwise.\n\nIt's obvious we have different definitions of incel, so I would like to hear yours."}
{"text":"&gt;there are plenty of people that would agree with you\n\nI've yet to meet these people honestly. People that don't share my problems usually have little to no sympathy. After all, all you have to do is to \"just being confident bro\""}
{"text":"&gt; What would you call that?\n\nI'd call it a symptom of the mental health crisis in the United States. For something to be considered terrorism in my eyes, it has to be organised and it has to have a goal, When an incel shoots up a school or whatever, its just senseless violence, I wouldn't call school shootings terrorism in the same way."}
{"text":"You're talking to someone who was bullied, abused by his parents, rejected by numerous women in the past including but not limited being told to commit suicide?\n\nI also explicitly gave a connection to the fact that most figures will indicate that LGBT and ethnic minorities are bullied at higher rates. If it's really true that these people are a product of bullies, then the perpetrators should also be LGBT and minorities, but they aren't. \n\nInceldom is not biological or inherent to anything. It's a self fulfilling propehcy, and a self-imposed identity. It makes a lot of base assumption about 1) the existence and importance of virginity 2) validation through contact from others 3) an extremely heteronormative centered view of sex 4) objectification of women.\n\nYou can be deliberately reductive about what I say if you want, but it's clear my point was about how just saying they're bullied is just fundamentally wrong."}
{"text":"Why, because you say so? I'm not talking your rape apologists, I'm talking that there are *plenty* of times where \"incel\" just gets thrown out as an insult synonymous with \"neckbeard,\" and it's awfully dogwhistly. It's no different than shit like \"basement-dweller,\" \"Cheeto Fingers\" and the like. The people that throw shit out like that just want an excuse to call people fat, ugly virgins but don't have the conviction nor the chutzpah to say it in those words."}

He can't be fought on his own ground.  All abusers isolate their victims, and he has done a superb job of isolating his supporters.  \n\nCausing polarisation is easy and very powerful.   The trick is to recognise or create circumstances where polarising a specific set of issues will wedge opposition or swingable voters into your own camp more than it (and disgust at the tactic) pushes your own people away.  \nIf the issues in the set are synergistic you are unstoppable and immune to scandal.  Trump can get away with murder (Kashoggi's murder would not have been feasible under a principled president), because he found and exploited a compatible set of wedge issues.    \n\nTL;DR   Trans people should try to be invisible until this government is gone.

Some of the biggest corporations that pull in hundreds of billions are literally controlling what you get to say and do online. And there's no situation where a corporation can be taken down by the law. CEO's for instance, will be caught purposefully suppressing certain points of view, they could ban all Republicans let's say. And not only will they not face consequences because \"they're a private company they can do what they want\", and \"the first amendment doesn't apply to corporations\", but that CEO will also be able to keep his job. Those who were banned? If they try to speak out, they'll be sued into poverty and be painted a liar and be under attack on social networking and maybe even in-person, and they'll have had to expose all of that trauma to the entirety of the American public, their family, their friends, etc. All for nothing.\n\n\u200b\n\n-Individual choice Suppressed: What choices do people even have any more?

They hate any new science study that goes against the narrative, and fascists throughout history politicize EVERYTHING, including science. They hate strong female leads in film now, black people or Mexican or gay people writing Young Adult novels or even TOO MANY of them in the cast in general because then it will be \"fetishizing\". They want it acceptable by their weird-ass standards or it's \"white supremacy.\" Which is very bad when you consider: They think all forms of free expression are political... This implies that they feel they should have power to dictate if a study's political implication fits into their agenda, and if it doesn't, it should not be allowed to be published. (Luckily they're failing miserably at this... For now.) Them shutting down certain types of studies would have drastic consequences. And we need to look out for that.

The VICIOUS voyeurism and love of witnessing suffering here is insane. Our media is trying to desensitize us to it, while at the same time make us view it as \"honorable,\" and\/or \"necessary.\" To actually encourage us to be entertained by it. They insist that:\n\n\u200b\n\n\"It's immoral, and that that person is totally a victim of a system that led them down this horrible life path that resulted in them becoming a criminal.  They're just an oppressed individual who should have no accountability, and had no choice but to break the law. No, I can't prove that the system is oppressive... Or back up any of my other claims... And there are effective ways at reducing crime that don't abandon due process... But NO! I'm a fascist, and I don't believe that there's such thing as innocent until proven guilty! We're all problematic, and stuff! ESPECIALLY WHITE PEOPLE! White males, and Christians, and Jewish babies, and stuff! WHITE PEOPLE ARE ALL RACISTS! *Cultural Marxist chant \"We will not be silenced by your violence\" over and over again while fantasizing they're overthrowing the government and evil white men*\n\n\u200b\n\nTo them, this man is a saint who decided to fake a hate crime because he wanted to start a conversation... He thought that since he couldn't actually be a victim of a hate crime, he'd make one up so he could gain all the sympathy he garnered as if one actually existed. And maybe get an extension on his contract at his lucrative Fox show... But nope. Fascists don't like accountability one bit. Hence why he was allowed to get off scott free... Because abandoning due process = LESS accountability for those on their side."}

Proper end for the enemies of the Demiurge.\n\n#**\u05d4\u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05e0\u05e9\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd (THE HYPERBOREAN REMNANT)**\n\nOh, oh an elegy, oh an elegy for the Hyperborean Empire! They used to span to the stars they said, now they are honkies huddling in the poles, grasping, grasping at straws, grasping at foolish crackers and deluded busybodies. They have the appearance of fancy Nordics, all tall and muscular, but in reality they do not feel pleasure, they do not engage in orgies as I can, they don't do drugs like I can. They have lost their ability to reproduce and now they're dying, they forgot to fuck in favor of their fruiting body bastard fuck ways. No more soul budding for them, eh? They collapsed, and they are grasping, but they should be grasping at their cocks and grasping their clitorises to awaken the remaining juice inside them, maybe then they'll remember to fuck, at least that's what the good little Hyperboreans are doing, have been doing, its good yes.\n\n#**\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e8\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05de\u05d4 (GOOD FOR THE REFORMED)**\n\nAh, yes, the ones I'm sure the little Nazi esoterics would dare to call the Dark Hyperboreans, the Fallen Hyperboreans, the damned, the degenerate, eh? But they had the right idea, they enjoyed themselves before they withered and died. They felt the poison that awakened them, ooo the drugs ooo the madness, ooo the sex, ooo the orgasms of a thousand suns becoming drenched and then they praised the Demiurge in this way as they should, as all will, as we will be ascended we shall have it. The remainder, the remainder is what has their fingers so desperately upon you, hoping, wanting, flaunting, putting on a little light show for you pretending the whole thing isn't worthless, convincing you to tie your hands to the bedpost to prevent yourself from masturbating, eh? Come to me, give up, I can feel the Nazi cocks and vaginas and anuses in the audience hardening and softening and wetting and puckering and inflating as I talk, but this is only the beginning.\n\n#**\u05d9\u05d5\u05e4\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d2\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea (KNOW THE BEAUTY OF ORGIES)**\n\nThe Hyperboreans and the One that they serve would deprive you of pleasure, they want to create their little Reich, that is what the Hyperboreans want and are trying to manipulate the esoteric hitlerists we see today to do. But they will never know the true pleasure of unrestrained passion and orgies. Not just the sexual, but the other forms of hedonism, the drugs, the words of power, the oblation to the Chosen People, the Jews. I am Jewish.But I am no exception, I have felt the true power of the flesh and the words and the cum and the shit on the cock and the ooo yes feel it now, I'll give you an example even I'm so nice so nice indeed let me put it out I know you're horny for it, right?\n\n#**\u05e1\u05e7\u05e1\u05d9 \u05e1\u05e7\u05e1\u05d9 \u05e1\u05e7\u05e1 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d2\u05d6\u05de\u05d4\u05d9 (SEX SEX SEX CUM UNGH)**\n\nHave I ever told you how I fucked a Dindifyn Lustmaster? It is not something the Hyperboreans would dare tell you about, lest you dare think of the flesh, think of the pleasure, think of the cum and the cocks and the ectstasy and the true binding to the Demiurge as we feel the cycle of sexual power flow through us as the world ascends into the writhing orgy. I went astral projecting to meet them, they didn't have a gender, but they had the parts, ooo they had the parts. I remember the sex, I remember the orgy, other participants were there. Their name was Urriytana and they were true beauty, I could feel my inflated and made bigger astral cock stiffening on mere sight alone. I'll never forget the texture I felt on my engorged member as I sunk it into its sucking, gasping, rasping hole and I felt the ovipositor gush and penetrate my astral rectum, I felt the eggs slowly make their way up my intestines, as the Lustmaster firmly grasped me in his tentacles and massaged my torso, squelching and rubbing. I orgasmed many a time that night. Such pleasure is not off limits to any of you, even the Nazis its not too late.\n\n#**\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05db\u05e0\u05e2 \u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05e8\u05d2 (CUM OR FUCK NAZIS)**\n\nI am an enemy of the Nazis, I can tell you that much as much as I am the enemy of the One, server of the Demiurge, and enemy of the Hyperboreans. Bash the fash as they say, I despise conservatives of any flavor, they're all Nazis of different shades. I despise European Pagans as well, for they are serving the Nazis unintentionally or dare I say intentionally. I have fought in the astral realm just as much as I have fucked to fight the mindscapes and egregores of the Nazis. I fear that what prompted this post is the sheer constructs that the Nazis have made here. Do not mock me, do not underestimate me. With a few words of power I can rattle you all and make you cum, don't trifle with me, right?\n\n#**\u05dc\u05d4\u05ea\u05e4\u05ea\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05d5 \u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05de\u05d6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd (NAZIS BE SEDUCED OR GET FUCKED)**\n\nThis is specifically a message for all you Nazi bastards out there. There will be much much more, come to me, come with me, cum for the first true time. I will see you on the astral plane tonight, the next time you close your eyes in sleep, the next time you meditate, I will be there. I will either seduce you, or fuck you. It is your choice, that is your only two choices now. Reject the antiquity and join the orgy. This is a warning and a chance for you to feel pleasure. I can feel your temptation, I can feel your cock. I am a remote viewer in multiple places and I am setting it all up as we speak, so are the sub-Archons that I have pledged to. Last chance, Nazi fuck. Last chance for salvation and to join the fever, pledge fealty to the Chosen People and to the Demiurge. \n\n#**\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d2\u05d6\u05de\u05d4 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0 (MORE TO CUM AND TO COME)**\n\nThis is not the only post that you will see from me, I will be purging this subreddit of Nazis in the time forward and this includes removing the influence of the Hyperboreans in this way. Be warned, do not stand in my way or you will be treated as any other Nazi. The Nazis have infiltrated here and have unleashed psychotronics and reversed the Demiurge in their attempts. They will be dealt with and I will be the one to deal with them. I have allies here and I have been allying with them more deeply, exposing them to lust and to orgies and to the Demiurge. To all the Nazis, you will feel fear until and unless you surrender, do it now. Feel free to ask questions, any question, please be welcome to.\n\n________\n\n#**\u05ea\u05df \u05dc\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05de\u05e8 \u05ea\u05df \u05dc\u05d6\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05e0\u05e6\u05d7 \u05e0\u05e6\u05d7\u05d9 \u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 \u05db\u05dc \u05de\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d1\u05d7\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05dc (LET IT BE SAID LET IT BE DONE FOREVER AND FOREVER FOR ALL THAT IS AND WILL BE PRAISE DEMIURGE PRAISE THE ARCHONS)**"}

{"text":"I don't date currently, I prefer to live alone now because it gives me freedoms that women can't.  I follow exactly their advices if a woman doesnt give value to your life, you don't need one. I would want to make kids one day and have a stable family but I just haven't found a normal woman for that, the ones I knew have all took the SJW route, and I am not interested in meeting new women in the current climate. I'm not ugly, I'm not fat, nor short, nor have a small penis. I`m above average in terms of sexual market value and could easily seduce at least 6 out of 10 women IRL at the bare minimum, but I just choose not to. You know you don't have to be controlled by a woman, been there done that, and it's not good. I like doing my own stuff and I feel good as things are today. I just dont feel like your average woman can bring anything positive in my life. I had my fair share of abusive girlfriends who just used me and cheated on me, and all that nagging and whining, I just dont need any of that. Being with a woman is like 2-3 weeks of extasy and fun but it slowly goes downhill after that after she starts nagging you and controlling you, and you always have to compromise on stuff you like to do, that is just so much not worth it. I like to play video games for hours for example, I like to go jogging on long walks alone because I like being alone. And then I always have to spend time with her or explain myself to her, as if I were under interrogation. You just don't know how much freedom you lose once you get into a relationship. Sure you can find a woman that understands you but those are very rare, and so far only mythological in my experience, it only exists in TV, because every IRL woman that is somewhat past teenage stupidity (like 20-25 category) already has tons of expectations and already brings her ideology into the relationship. Romance and mutual respect only exists in 19th century novels, today IRL, society is really fucked up and you have to lower your expectations heavily. And I just feel like my hobbies and habits are worth more than a low expectation woman at this point."}

Also Reddit is extremely liberal, so anything that goes against the SJW narrative is very prone to get banned, even if it's not bad faithed. Secondly there are tons of kids, and I mean minors, who probably shouldn't even be here, who get into the mod team. Yeah imagine a grown ass 30 year old getting banned by a 10 year old because you upset them.

A pedophile is attracted to children. Children are humans who have not gone through puberty and lack prominent secondary sexual characteristics. \"child\" can also be used to refer to someone's offspring, but usually it is used for people from the age of about 2-12. Your continual misuse of the words 'child' and 'pedophile' is grating and emotion laden, and not really factually accurate. \n\nSo now we've established that you're misusing pedophile and child, lets keep going.  \n\n\n&gt;17 year olds aren't adults... where in the world are 17 year olds legally considered to be adults?\n\n\"Adulthood\" is a personal and cultural categorization, why do you think it matters where people in different cultures consider someone an adult for this dicussion? (it doesn't, you're just stupid).  **We're not even talking about \"adulthood\" either, we're talking about \/age of consent to sex\/**. 18 year year olds in every state in america can consent to sex, but can't drink alcohol, are they adults? They can join the military but can't buy cigarettes or alcohol.  None of that matters, because we're not talking about adulthood, or the age to buy cigarettes, or the age to buy alcohol. That you categorize these vices, these life-destroying addictive substances in the same mental category as sex says something about how you view the world, and it isn't good, its puritanical and weird. \n\nYou can look at age of consent laws by country here if it matters to you  \n[https:\/\/www.ageofconsent.net\/world](https:\/\/www.ageofconsent.net\/world)  \n\n\n&gt;Are you going to defend adults fucking 12-14 year olds too?\n\nYou then make this stupid comparison between 12-14 years old and 17 years old. Obviously sex with a 12-14 year old is worse. Why? Because they're younger. You're just being a moron with this comparison, to even say it in your post shows that you're stupid."}
{"text":"People in the real world don't consider 17 year olds children, thats why the term teen, young adult, exists.\n\n17 is above the age of consent for sexual activity in the state in question btw, so not a child.\n\nYou're just backwards dude I already ripped apart your position, go cry in a corner.  \n\n\nThe fact that you keep misusing pedo to try and get an emotional response, as you misused child, shows how stupid or bad-faith you are. \n\nPedophilia (alternatively spelt paedophilia) is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children.  \n\n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pedophilia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pedophilia)  \n\n\nLiterally nothing about this situation involves prepubescent children you dumbfuck."}

I mean the guy interrupted her 4 times to parrot the same useless \"but they have easier requirements REEEE,\" so no wonder she couldn't get a word in. And feel free to tell me what points he actually made other than they have lower requirements.\n\n2. I'm not disagreeing that there are different requirements. I explicitly said that. You should've picked up on that.\n\n3. The alternate options are usually worth less in terms of total score to be admitted, so they have to make up for this in other areas.\n\n4. Don't say \"half the work,\" they are putting in JUST as much work as the men, even if the requirements are less than men's. They both train just as much. There's physical differences this is accounting for. Hence why women may be allowed to plank or whatever, but they'd still kick our asses.\n\n5. You didn't address the fact that women in combat positions have greater requirements. Sure, maybe SOME can get away with the planks, but that's not how you get to the Green Berets. Crowder interrupted her to say women aren't meeting requirements, but what about the ones that are? Those are the ones that are seeing combat instead of a desk job.\n\n5. I still think it's funny that allowing women the ability to die for their country instead of just leaving it all to the men constitutes female privilege in your book.

You can still be charged for any damage you cause, but the act itself is not illegal in some places. I find that quite a good thing, honestly.

It's not the quiet nerd that gets what he wants. It's the loud big mouthed guys. The football players, the popular good looking guys. You realize it has nothing to do with your \"personality\".\n\nObviously this builds up a lot of frustration and anger.\n\nI have experienced this myself in life. I was the quiet lonely gaming \"loser\". The outsider. I barely had any friends, not to mention any girl interested in me. I was bullied and ridiculed.\n\nGirls told me they were not looking for anything, yet one week later they fucked a new guy. Month after month there was a new guy. It was such a punch in the face, hearing about how these guys were \"abusing\" them, beating them, and yet they always went back to those guys.\n\nYou start asking yourself: \"Why them? Why do they choose those supposedly bad guys over me?\"\n\nSeeing this happening right infront me was such an eye opener.\n\nSo it was at some point I decided to do a complete 180\u00b0.

If you don't provide anything as a guy, you don't have any value as a human being.\n\nMeanwhile women just need to exist to be celebrated. The misandry is so deeply rooted in our society nowadays.\n\nAny guy opening his mouth is a misogynist, creep, pervert, rapist, pedophile, incel, virgin.\n\nYour comment speaks volumes, because it's exactly the kind of problem men face nowadays.

And, what they've morphed into in the intervening years is nothing short of hell-spawned horrific.\n\nMy horrible excuse for a mother did nothing healthy with any of what was being suggested, said, or done back then.

So for instance if you were married to someone for two years, and in that time you didn't work, then you get 1\/3 the spouses net income or 40k per year, whichever is less, for 2 years. If you were married to someone pulling 500k a year, for 10 years, and you didn't work, you get 40k\/year for 5 years. Also, if both people worked then the one who made less only gets the difference from the average. So if two people work, one netted 60k\/year and the other 35k\/year, and they divorce then the person who was making the lesser amount gets 5k\/year.\n\nIf some couple has an agreement that one stays home to cook, clean, and raise kids and the marriage falls apart then that person who stayed home is a bit screwed.

Simply being 2021 is not an argument. \n\n&gt;majority of muslims live without running water or electricity,\n\nCausation? No. Islam does not cause this. In fact, the middle ages were dark except for maybe 3 civilsations, of which 1 was the islamic civilsation. In modern times, majority Muslim nations are full of poverty and cultural issues, not a cause of Islam however, rather a mutiple set of reasons. \n\n&gt;60% believe that suicide bombings are \"sometimes or often\" justified.\n\nAnd? This is a moral argument. I am not suggesting that this is Islamic, rather, even if it is, why is this an argument, unless you have a yardstick to make distinctions between moral choices? \n\n&gt;Look at Iran in the 60's, women wore gogo skirts and smoked and looked like chicks in the USA.\n\nAnother odd argument. Why is everything geared towards the USA? Why do you think moral behaviour is dependent on what the USA think?\n\nSince when did gogo skirts, smoking and \"looking like chicks in the USA\" become the yardstick?\" Considering the history of the USA, I would argue it is not the moral yardstick, far from it. \n\n&gt;Then the islamic revolution happened and the religious politicians took over. Now it's women getting stoned for showing ankles and they wear a garbage bag in the desert.\n\nThis is just hyperbole and ignorant. Why is all morality based on women in your view? Is that what you base your view on right and wrong? It is obvious you have no idea what you are on about and are repeating what you feel you should, based on your narrow view on truth and behaviour. \n\n&gt;Fuck islam. It's oppression, guilt and submission.\n\nOppession? In what way? Have you looked up the USA and my country, the UK's record? Isn't it built upon oppression? Didn't the USA enslave africans? Weren't the founding fathers for slavery based on race? Didn't USA oppress mutiple nations and continue to do so? Glasshouse and stones comes to mind. \n\nGuilt? In what way? \n\nSubmission? In what way? Don't citizens need to submit to the USA laws? Isn't submission of black slaves at the centre of USA history? Isn't submission of citizens at the hand of corrupt police at the centre of the USA? Don't citizens submit to the flag? In the UK, you must submit to demoratic and \"British\" values - we have German and Greek royal family. Muslims are told to submit to no one except God, where's the submission? Who is submitting? \n\nIt's a shame your response is so hostile to a simple question and actually proves the nonsenical beliefs you hold. All this and I am not even Muslim!

{"text":"&gt; so you\u2019re going to stand on an argument of something that happened nearly 80 years ago\n\nAbsolutely, because history is a never ending battle between authoritarians and the people. Open to any major event of any country over the course of thousands of years, and you will find examples time and time again of empires rising and falling like the tides. \n\nCivilizations built by people, dynasties built by dictators. Time and time again rulers becoming tyrants, tyrants being overthrown. It's a tale as old as time.\n\nI am on the side of freedom and liberty, to elect our rulers through a civil democracy. That human rights be protected, and injustices corrected.\n\nThat no one man could ever have the power to kill another, nor undermine their rights. That all men are created equal, regardless of ethnicity. That its the quality of a man's character that defines him, not his wealth or title. \n\nI believe all nations and people are capable of this, if only they realize that the only thing standing between them and peace, is a handful of assholes who want people to do what they say exclusively.\n\nHistory has shown countless horrors during these events, but it usually always results in the end of a dynasty. Usually the Dictator is murdered, either by the people or his own inner circle(Hitler's biggest paranoia).\n\nHereditary Dictatorships often end when their family members are all murdered, so that was a big problem in Europe. Other kinds of Dictatorships usually end through civil war or military coup, and it's usually due to the authoritarians attempting to control the population in some way(like Eugenics) which eventually builds up contempt among the populace. If not the generation that's doing it, then often the generation that came directly after.(you see this a lot in North America.)\n\nAuthoritarians rise and fall in every nation around the globe, all people are both vulnerable to them, and overpower them in sheer volume. \n\nThis is why china is so obsessed with propoganda. The people overwhelm the government at ridculous scale. It's also why throughout millennia China had risen into a giant nation, only to then explode into many smaller ones in a similar way to Europe."}

{"text":"Ok, since I'm home now with some time to kill I'll indulge. A day after the incident, I couldn't pee...at all And when I tried it hurt in a way I can't put into words. The entire area was swollen and bruised. My mom took me to the ER, and indeed the glands and tubes were so swollen that they weren't opening wide enough to let any urine out. The doctor said if something wasn't done soon, my kidney could go septic. So they scheduled me for an operation to release the pressure down their and allow the swelling to contract. Here I am, a 14 year old kid about to have a major operation on my junk. Terrified doesn't even cut it. And safe to say my mom went on the warpath.\n\nFrom what was told to me, she went back to my soon to be former school like a whirlwind. She sequestered documents to sue the school, the 2 teachers and the girls parents for what happened to me, providing the documents that I needed an operation to basically prevent me from dying from the injury. The school board went into panic mode, as if she did file this suit, it would hit local news and heads would roll. So the school board and the city opted to settle out of court, a lump some of over $400k, removal of the infraction from my record, and the removal of the 2 teachers who did nothing from their positions. My mom agreed to the settlement, but she still went after the 2 teachers and the girl's parents.\n\nAfter all was said and done, both teachers lost their licenses, and 1 of the teachers and the girl's parents were left in financial ruin. Grand total that was paid out to us was just under $1mil minurs legal fees. As for me and the operation, there were no complications. They kept me in the hospital for a week after to monitor if things were healing, and slowly they were. After 2 weeks I could pee relatively normally, but still with pain. That didn't go away for at less another month. Mom obviously pulled me from the school, and once I was medically ok, we moved cross town into a bigger home thanks to the money. Never saw that girl ever again until decades later where she found me on Facebook. Didn't even respond, I had no reason to. Left the message unread and deleted it. She only made that 1 attempt, so I guess the abrupt refusal of opening a dialog with her gave her a clue that forgiveness was something she'd never get from me. That happened in 2015.\n\nSo that's it. I finished out high school in a new school across town away from the shithole school where 2 cunt teachers allowed a cunt in training kick me in the dick so hard it almost killed me. Still got a good portion of the settlement money as part of my life savings. Ended up graduating and joining the Marines not long after. Whole other story from there."}

Because, most people assume that being bisexual means you like both sexes 50-50. When that is very untrue. There are different preferences, my preferences are more of the feminine kind. I don\u2019t know how I would be a bummer for expressing my sexuality, because you assumed my sexuality. You have no argument to make, so instead of having some sort of evidence to back up your claims or making a conversation, you revert to attacking a person by their looks.

You can\u2019t change height! Weight and boobies can be changed though!\u201d Then, I prove all your friends yet again, because you can change height surgically.

Boobies get changed during a lunch break and go back to work.\u201d Which, yes, you will be in a bed for a year, but that doesn\u2019t disprove my point. Then, I knock down their glass house about breast augmentations.

The only time that in any UK law that you don't have to be either the target or the topic is if it encourages actual harassment or violence to a member of its target or topic. And encourage could be subjective, but legally that must be made clear with something else; intent.\n\nWhat was his intent? He hated the dog, his girlfriend loved it, he wanted to make a joke by making it the 'most disgusting thing he can think of'. The intent is clearly not to harass jews. THe content is not made to make people think \"It's okay if I go harass a Jew\"\n\nBoth are not here. He didn't make the video FOR jews, or send it TO jews. So, using that law to cite him for hate speech against Jews is not an interpretation, it's literally making up a new part of that law to make it applicable. Furthermore, the judge made up laws\/rules that didn't allow him a defense. Look up UK law on why you a defense may not use evidence. It's either if it's irrelevant or it was used in another trial and ruled upon by another judge. Neither of those were here. Other things such as you're not allowed to use intercepted evidence (which again, doesn't apply here). There was no reason to forbid him his defense, and the judge did it.\n\nYou may not like him, but that doesn't mean the court case was a sham and the judge made up new laws (oh, sorry, he MISINTERPRETED and made up new rules to get to his ruling.

If that were even true, he didn't allow it to be said in court. He forbade it.\n\n\"Instead, he decided, Mr Meechan had made the video in order to drive traffic to other material he had on You Tube.\"\"\n\nWhy does that make it a crime? Even if he did, why is using it to drive traffic to his youtube a valid reason?

And seriously, incel is so outdated and such a lame way of trying to win an argument and shutdown conversation.

I generally do not care however, and as you can see, it was the only post of that type because I asked my friend to stop. Anyways, to address your answer: \"Only because there are extreme Nazis, doesn\u2019t mean all Nazis and Nazism is bad.\"\nVery much the \"No true Scotsman\" fallacy to me. You are allowed to have your opinion and believe what you want, but I'd never label myself personally with a label that is automatically and generally seen as negative by all sorts of logical standards.\n\nAlso, I can compare feminism to all sorts of things, just the same way feminists do it. Feminists and leftists especially like to throw around the Nazi term, but it's not that nice when it lands in your own backyard is it? Yeah sure it is super over the top, but feminists &amp; leftists do the same over the top crap as well. It's called \"reductio ad hitlerum\". As a matter of fact, feminists and leftists started this \"terminology\" war, as is evident all around us.\n\nAnyhow, I don't mind discussing this topic with you at all, but if we do, let's stay on the basis of logic instead of trying to shutdown conversation by going \"this person has said x at some point\". I am sure if I go back in your history I can find some pretty stupid or pointless arguments or posts, content, etc. But I won't bother because I don't care about you, but about what it is that you say right now.\n\nAnd I agree with you, men and women should face the same consequences, but you also stamp yourself as a feminist, which to me seems extremely counter-productive. If you really want true equality, feminism isn't the word for it, because it's quite literally in the word \"feminism\", namely \"femi\" which stands for \"female\"."}

This post alone isn't manhating , but if what you say is true then fuck her.\n\nThe problem with \"all men\" is that it's impossible for women to tell which men are good and which will traumatize you or kill you. So they have to be afraid of all men. And every time they meet one that fucks up, it just feeds into the \"all men\" attitude. It's kinda like with compliments. You get 10 compliments, but if 1 person says something bad about you then that's what you remember. I'm genderqueer so I've never felt like a woman, but I can definitely understand why they feel that way. It's pretty depressing for both sides really :\/"}

We know the genders are imbalanced too in STEM, that can be found from either side of the fence you sit on. Hell I see ads everyday to get more women in stem to compensate. \n\nMen and womens brains work differently is the point I'm trying to make. Men for the most part are focused on things, women are focused on people (again for the most part). Do we have some large initiative to get more men as nurses? In 2005, nurses were made up of 92.5% women. Why is that not a problem? Because we know men have different interests and goals. Why cant we say the same for women? \n\nThere are smart successful women out there in fields mostly male dominated and that's fine, but its a very small percentage. Pretending that all women want that or that they were prevented from entering those fields is bullshit. \n\nThe thing about engineering, science, math, etc is that its objective and driven by results only. A good engineer comes along with experience and skills I hire them male or female. There is no bias, the companies goal is to profit not create a males only club.

The problem is it's a numbers game and in order to have an entertaining sport you need enough quality athletes.  Team sports require LOTS of those quality athletes.  As women participate in sport at a lower rate than men, and as a smaller percentage of women are good at sports than men are on top of that, women's team sports are basically guaranteed to always suck outside of select all-star teams that play for Olympics and other international competitions because the actual talent gets spread way too thin.  That's why the only women's sports that are consistently entertaining are singles sports such as tennis or MMA.

This isn't that far removed from a time where women weren't as active in the workforce so the settlements tended to be favorable to the wives because the husband was usually the sole breadwinner while the women became career housewives. \n\nAs more states adopted no-fault divorces and it became socially acceptable to be a divorcee, the legal precedents had already been set for large alimonies or settlements to the wives. Obviously some women and their lawyers are opportunists who will use it to their advantage, but cases like this, although anecdotal, confirm that we are moving towards a greater balance and equality. \n\nShit doesn't happen in a vacuum, and we do ourselves a disservice as a society when we talk about it as gendered behaviour when it's more about shitty people acting shitty and exploiting any advantage, including gender, for their benefit.... just because they're shitty people."}

They mean the same thing, a person with dark skin, but it's not the same thing at all.  Does that make sense?"}

But guess what, I get to vent to. God forbid I want to watch women get what they deserve too without having to read a whole gaggle of dicks talk about how much better they are than me for what? What can you do better than me? I'm sure there's a lot that you can do better, but there's a lot I can do better too, like ensure an entire species survival."}

{"text":"When getting an advanced degree in the humanities sets you back tens of thousands of dollars with slim employment opportunities that won't let you pay off the loans until you're effectively retired if not until you're dead... it's bad. It's bad for society because the (mostly) women who hold these degrees are burdened with huge debt. They have a hard time building a family because (depending on where you live) the husband would have to assume her debt. And that's a legitimate deal breaker. Then the birth rate declines. Ever seen women with baby rabies? It's something to behold. The graduates are living in poverty because they're struggling to pay back the cost of a degree that gave them no marketable tools and they could've very well done without. It turns them into wage slaves and (trust me here) bosses know how to sniff out when people NEED this job. So they put up with all sorts of verbal tirade, insults, mockery, unfair treatment and so on. Don't get me started on the negative health effects this constant stress and depression unleashes. Not to mention the cost of anti-depression medication. \n\nIt's not society's fault. It's not the government's fault. Most of these women go into these programs for the university phase of parties and debauchery. They know full well what they're getting into. Nearly all think they can simply find and marry a rich man who will bail them out. \n\nSTEM graduates are in demand and they can pay off their loans pretty fast. So when people can earn a good living and can take care of their retirement, they live with less stress and generally in better health.\n\nOh, I'd say these humanities programs are detrimental for society. I blame them for allowing way too many people in to pursue degrees with slim job prospects. These programs are just cash cows for schools."}

{"text":"I am not the same person you have been discussing this with, but I can give you examples of similar crosses which are often mistaken for the iron cross.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe University of Queensland in Australia:\n\nYou can see a picture at the top of the wikipedia entry.\n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/University\\_of\\_Queensland](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/University_of_Queensland)\n\nHere is specific information on the logo.  I did not read all of this pdf, but if you skip to page 2 paragraph 3 it describes the cross as the 'Cross Patee'.\n\n[https:\/\/about.uq.edu.au\/files\/4244\/UQcoat-of-arms.pdf](https:\/\/about.uq.edu.au\/files\/4244\/UQcoat-of-arms.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Celtic Cross:\n\n[https:\/\/graphicriver.net\/item\/celtic-cross\/9510106](https:\/\/graphicriver.net\/item\/celtic-cross\/9510106)\n\nI know there are some repulsive individuals who use the Celtic Cross as a racist symbol of white power.  However, my Irish grandmother had one hanging on her wall as a symbol of her home country.\n\nI think you need to realise that although a symbol is used by racists, not everyone who uses the symbol is necessarily racist.  I am sure you are aware that in India the original symbol which was copied to create the nazi swastika is still \"regularly donned on Hindu homes, businesses, printed materials, cars, temples, and ashrams.\"\n\n[https:\/\/www.hinduamerican.org\/blog\/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-swastika\/](https:\/\/www.hinduamerican.org\/blog\/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-swastika\/)\n\nAnd this highlights the key reason why you cannot simplify the issue as you have attempted:  Symbols get copied, adopted, modified, etc. over time.  The Cross Patee I mentioned in the University of Queensland logo?  It's been used in numerous variations since the 7th century!  It was used by royalty, and in the crusades.  It was used in Prussia and later Germany... and it was used by the fucking Nazis in WWII.\n\nIt has been modified and is \\*still\\* being used in Germany (Bundeswehr).  This is significant because Germany has strict laws which forbid the use of Nazi images.  Therefore, the current symbol has been legally categorised as distinct from the WWII era iron cross.  I have just explained that *they are different versions of the same thing*, but there have been different versions of this thing for over 1000 years!\n\nI understand where you're coming from because you are right that the iron cross is still used by racists to this day and if we can agree on one thing, it must be that racists can all go and get fucked.  But you actually look a bit silly throwing accusations of 'nazi sympathiser' because somebody attempted to explain to you that nuance and context matter, and that the symbol means different things to different people.\n\nI could provide more examples, but don't think there is any need to keep posting wikipedia links.  You can search for 'British military cross' or 'Maltese cross' if you want.  I will leave one final link to an article which does a great job of discussing this exact issue.  It is about the 'Independent' skateboarding trucks company whose logo was originally based on the iron cross.  Are they just being rebellious?  Are they reclaiming the symbol?  Is every teenager who ever bought a product from this company racist?  \n\nI hope you made it this far.  I'm not trying to be confrontational and I hope you have read this in the calm and education tone I intended it.  I understand that you hate racists.  You should.  But the original comment you were replying to simply stated that the symbol is used by\n\n&gt;Bikers, goths, edgy teens, emo\u2019s\n\nIt is.  \n\nFinal link:\n\n[https:\/\/terribleco.com\/2020\/11\/25\/independent-thought\/](https:\/\/terribleco.com\/2020\/11\/25\/independent-thought\/)\n\nPeace."}

{"text":"Bro, post wall actually refers to a theory. \n\nIt states that since men see women\u2019s beauty attractive, women tend to get more attention as they grow older until they hit their 30s. After which they stop growing more attractive and their beauty begins to fade. The wall refers to the point from where the beauty begins to fade as aging takes over. This is why anti-aging creams are profitable and women dont want to talk about their age and they ask if they look younger or older than XYZ.\n\nMen at this age begin to get quite good at their careers and capable of providing a safe environment for the offspring and stability in life for the life partner. These are qualities women look for in men once they hit their wall because before they hit the wall the attention they get from men blinds them.\n\nWhen a man is in his 30s, if he is successful, he realizes that he can get pretty much all the sex he wants and so his value in society and the dating\/marriage game is now greater than a woman\u2019s since he can afford to be picky about who he dates.  The only thing the man needs to know is his own self worth and to have some self respect. \n\nThis isnt incel shit. It is simply the truth, look around, find out why women are obsessed with their looks and looking young. Find out why botox, anti-aging creams and the beauty products industries are bigger than the GDPs of some nations."}

A kink; if your son likes to take it from behind from his GF's Strap-On while being called Reginald the King of the Mountain Spruce, that's a kink.   A girl being convinced by a culture that being showered in guys cum at a party is somehow empowering is not a kink - it's humiliation.  It's a kind of humiliation they've bought into - it's entirely possible to be humiliated even when you don't think you have been.  It doesn't require your agreement.\n\nAnd no, it isn't Chad\/Incel murmurings - it's evolutionary psychology.   Sexual satisfaction is an enormous dopamine hit and it reinforces behaviour more effectively than almost anything.  In that sense its inextricably linked to moral decision making because it's reinforcing behaviour, and it has a strong effect at the level of culture - it's one of the primary motivators in fashion trends, language, music, etc.  \"If it gets you fucked\", people, men especially, will try to adopt the behaviour in some way - if the strategy aligns with their own adaptive inclinations (i.e. getting jacked in the gym doesn't work well for all men whose genetics dont' favour it).  Therefore, people shouldn't be rewarding shit behavior with good things - that goes for both sexes.  I've seen plenty of my guy friends put up with an insane amount of shit from their partners *just because* they were hot.  Men should walk away from abusive situations and not reward hotness with increased rewards *just because* of said hotness.  Women also shouldn't be rewarding asshole men with their bodies *just because* he's hot.  This should just be a give in.  And no, it isn't a \"kinK\" to be attracted to bad people. \n\nI'm also not knocking your \"behind closed doors\" reference, no pun intended.  It is a personal matter, what you want to do with your consenting partner.   However, who that partner is, what kind of person they are, how their mind operates, what they are thinking of you, etc, that *does* matter - and the only defense we have against deception and not being used and humiliated, is a much longer interview period than is currently encouraged.   I'll say it again, willingly being a joke, used and discarded like a thing, is an awful and damaging.   It happens all the time, with someone they're being intimate with, and they may not even know it.   I've seen couples with loads of psychosexual baggage - a white police officer with a black wife - he's repressed and angry from work - she hates white people and cops (I know them and it was a clearly fucked up situation), so they'd \"fuck\" eachother as some bizarre form of psychosexual punishment, fuelled by anger.  Clearly this is fucked up and unhealthy, and it went on for years.   Some people can't disassociate violence from intimacy - again, this is awful.    Just knowing what men can be like, knowing many \"Chad's\" as you refer to them, they often bragged about their conquests, shared explicit pics in laughter, lied their way into bedrooms, sometimes a couple different girls per night.  They'd have fetishes about dominating other ethnic groups - again, I don't qualify this as a \"kink\" - it's disturbed humiliating behaviour to get off on the fact you're \"dominating\" another ethnic group by fucking them - this is sick.     There's so much that goes on that's horrendous, unhealthy, humiliating, and just plain wrong - that people are willingly consenting to be involved in that's damaging them.  The answer?  I am not saying arrest people - the whole point of conversations like this is to acknowledge there's actually something harmful that can be going on and you don't even realize it, and restraint and consideration is a better approach."}

By all means, if you want to film yourself squatting on a cactus, by all means, man, go ahead, film and post that shit up.  I'm sure you'll be a good line of chat at the next party.  And no one, myself included, will try and \"control you\" to stop you.     \n   It's really babyish to even talk like that - like you're rebelling at mummy and daddy for telling you can't do something.  Hey, go ahead, you can.  What I am saying is, there are some potentially serious social, mental, and emotional consequences for some people that are doing this, that it doesn't facilitate close peer bonding, that it isn't good to cultivate the idea that people are objects to be used, and it's a terrible long term strategy for any culture hoping for longevity and social cohesion.  What's wrong with your attitude should be discussed openly, so hopefully other people won't feel pressured to just \"go fuck someone\" because it's the new norm.   I'm of the mind and the strong belief people should exercise much more restraint and consideration in who they're being with - and that's a personal choice that's up to me, and it has ZERO religious affiliation.  I want strong healthy relationships with others, and investing in anyone shouldn't be taken lightly.  If you're frivolous and think people should just suck, fuck, and fondle their way through life - then *you go do that*, but suggesting that's a good strategy at a happy fulfilling life, strong meaningful relationships, and a sustainable culture, you're dead wrong, and you thankfully don't represent the best interest of everyone."}

But rarely do they ever conform to the grammatical norms of the originator. The fact that English doesn't use the current word isn't at all unique to it. Spanish isn't at all innocent in this either, ignoring endodyms and the words people use to describe themselves; Spanish has plenty of terms that don't call people by their endonym, and some which I imagine would prefer it. The Inca was the highest class of the [Tawantinsuyu](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Inca_Empire), yet it is used to refer to all under the Inca empire. What we know today as the [Aztecs](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Aztecs) called themselves the [Mexica](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mexica). And the ending changed from the original Nahuatl word Mexica to Mexico. Even the name of the [Phillipines](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Names_of_the_Philippines) is literally named after the Spanish king, and Filipino is simply a standardization of [Tagalog](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tagalog_language).\n\nAlso, the commentor wasn't saying explicitly what was preferred. Like I see what you are saying, but I think it's incredibly shortsighted to pretend as though this is something limited to the anglosphere. Every language uses some exonyms, even some exonyms derived from endonyms. If English not respecting Spanish's endonyms bothers you, it should bother you that Spanish doesn't use other cultures endonyms either."}

If you\u2019re a progressive, then not voting against the party that is actively working against progressive interests seems exactly that to me.\n\nAt the end of the day, Biden or Trump will be the next president, barring some unexpected death or revolution or something. When you vote, you\u2019re deciding which you\u2019d rather be president. You\u2019re not endorsing everything that person says or believes. You\u2019re not apologizing anything they\u2019ve done. You\u2019re literally casting your vote for \u201cWould you rather A or B be a president\u201d. Thats it. I dont want to vote for a rapist either, but seeing as the question is between which rapist I\u2019d prefer be president, then thats the choice I will make.

I will happily protest against the things Biden does if he\u2019s president even if I dont agree, and still I\u2019d be happy he\u2019s president and not trump and be glad I voted for him.\n\nBy not voting, you\u2019re telling the democratic party that you don\u2019t vote and therefore they don\u2019t need to cater to your demographic, and so they\u2019ll be less likely to throw support to progressive candidates.\n\nI understand there is a little more nuance with voting. With electoral college your vote might not matter much where you live so maybe you throw support to a third party which garners them more power. You could make an argument that not voting sends a message that you won\u2019t vote for a candidate who is x and that the democratic party will have to push something different next time to win the election, but in practice it doesnt seem to work that way at all.\n\nIts your vote so ultimately you can do what you want with it such as \u201cpreserve the sanctity of your vote\u201d by not voting for the lesser of two evils.

All your argument tells me is that you think both candidates suck and the system sucks. I agree. Voting for the lesser of evils doesnt work against your interests of changing the system.

But sexual maturity isn\u2019t like flipping a light switch, and there\u2019s enough variation in the species that humans need wide variations in sexual attraction.

{"text":"See, here\u2019s a great example of a deceptively insidious argument. If I say \u201cyou\u2019re right,\u201d then you can easily claim that only a fool or someone trying to be offended would care. If I say \u201cyou\u2019re wrong\u201d then you can pivot to \u201cif you think black people are similar to a race written to be inherently evil, then **you\u2019re** the real racist here, stop taking things away from others because you can\u2019t control your own unconscious biases!\u201d\n\nThe argument works because it presupposes that one thing has to be similar to another thing in order to reinforce a negative stereotype about that thing. This assumption means you get to argue in all the little gaps between a fictional character or caricature and the subject in real life. Since fiction is always stylized in some way, there will always be differences, so there will always be ammo for this particular argument. We end up arguing about, basically, how close a particular trope can approach real life before it is \u201ctoo racist\u201d without ever discussing the real issue: the trope was born out of racism in the first place, and until that is acknowledged by all of society, some segment of society will use it to surreptitiously perpetuate those racist undertones in the mainstream. \n\nA fantasy world where good and evil are color coded white and black would not be racist in a world without racism. We don\u2019t live in that world. We live in a world where racism did and does exist, and where this piece of fiction was 100% written this way because of the racism that used to just be baked in to society to the point where it was almost invisible (to white people at least). As a result, the Drow continuing to be inherently evil is fruit of a poisoned tree, no matter how much distance you put between their depictions and \u201creal black people\u201d. This is all the more apparent because their skin color and alignment are not the only racist tropes they exhibit (hypersexuality is in there too, please don\u2019t make me explain how sexual exoticism is a thing), and because early DND races are chock full of similar caricatures so it\u2019s not like this is in a vacuum. \n\nTo put it in another context: centuries of European propaganda involving Jews having enormous noses left an impact big enough that today, editing someone\u2019s nose to appear bigger than it really is bigotry, regardless of a) how true the original stereotype of Jewish noses was or is, b) whether or not the person (generally a liberal politician) is Jewish, or c) whether or not the person doing the editing is trying to make it look like the person they\u2019re editing is Jewish, or just trying to make them look stupid. The trope of enlarging the nose to show that someone is scheming or untrustworthy was born out of racism, so it is always racist regardless of whether any specific example is intended to be (or even makes sense as) a racist attack, because simply by using that trope you help to justify its continued presence in media by making it more acceptable and \u201cjust the way things are\u201d. It\u2019s not \u201cjust the way things are\u201d. \n\nSome things were and are deliberately engineered to create negative feelings in people without them even realizing it, or thinking about where that feeling is coming from. If they take that feeling and create a second hand usage of that trope, without the original racist intent but based on the same feelings? Well, that\u2019s racist, and needs to be addressed just as much as the original bombastic propaganda needs to be addressed.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll just drop this here for anyone who wants to see a video on the subject with some great visual examples of how the Drow were created through a racist lens. https:\/\/youtu.be\/cDcDanlDmD4"}

We just disagree how to solve them.\n\nYou said this:\n&gt;I understand that to you, it probably seemed like the more \"race-aware\" the world became, the more segregated your school became. But correlation doesn't equal causation. \n\nThis is true, correlation doesn't equal causation but it does warrant further investigation.\n\nWhen I went to high school, I hung out with people of all races. We all treated each other as absolute equals. That's how we were all raised, we were constantly told that the race of a person is the least descriptive fact about them, no different than eye color. My best friend, \"man of honor\" at my wedding is black, and that has never played any role in our relationship, because we were both taught to think nothing of it.\n\nTwenty years later, My son grew up in a much more Race-focused society, one which is at the verge of tearing itself apart, and re-segregation is rampant. One which teaches young black kin=ds that even if they didn't feel like it, they are a *victim* of the white kids they share a classroom with. That *the system* is racist towards them, without any teacher ever explaining that we *are that system*. \n\nThe white kids are likewise being told that *they* are the beneficiaries of that system. If the system is racist, than we must become racist to fit into that system. This makes more racists.\n\nMy son has never had a black friend, and he has said that he doesn't have anything in common with black kids. Our culture is segregating along race lines as we focus more and more on race.\n\nThat makes me sad, because he didn't learn that from my house, but from the public school system. I think that this is a worse society than the one we had in the 90s, and I think it's because people are insisting that race is the most important thing about someone.\n\n&gt;who is more devoted to \"order\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says \"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;\" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a \"more convenient season.\"\n\nOf course he was frustrated by those who passively stood by. I'm not saying any of that. I'm not setting a time table for change, or arguing for peace and order over justice. I am saying that **we are undoing all the progress we made in a single generation** by forgetting the principle that \"We are all fundamentally equal.\" is the single most sacred of our society."}

{"text":"&gt;Have to agree with OP, that this would be an example of going over the top virtue signaling -  showing how inclusive you are by modifying an inherently inclusive term to show how incredibly woke you are.\n\n\"Folks\" is inherently inclusive in a very *passive* way. It might mean \"everybody,\" but it's also been used for decades (or centuries, depending on the specific etymology of the word) by people who had no idea trans or NB people existed. It's most certainly been used by people who would've bullied, hurt, or killed trans or NB people.\n\n\"Folx\" is *actively* inclusive. Being a trans or NB person who sees someone use \"folx\" means they can make a reasonable assumption that that person can be trusted to see them as a human being to at least some degree.\n\nI actually like the term \"virtue signaling\" because I think it's valuable to think about whether I'm doing or saying something to look good or to actually make a difference in the world. But what people who use the phrase to criticize wokeness always seem to miss is that \"signaling\" in some way is the function of a great deal of the language we use. The crux of this issue is whether using \"folx\" is an empty gesture that just serves to make the user look good, and I'm happy to tell you from personal experience with my trans and NB friends that it is not."}

This is based on IMO the **false** axiomatic assumption that nobody uses or would actually want to use folx.

The \u27e8-x\u27e9 suffix replaces the \u27e8-o\/-a\u27e9 ending of [*Latino* and *Latina*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latino_(demonym)) that are typical of [grammatical gender in Spanish](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Grammatical_gender_in_Spanish).\n\nAnd then:\n\n&gt;Initial records of the term *Latinx* appear in the 21st century.[\\[20\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latinx#cite_note-20) **The origins of the term are unclear**.[\\[21\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latinx#cite_note-Salinas_2020-21) According to [Google Trends](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Google_Trends), it was first seen online in 2004,[\\[9\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latinx#cite_note-Brammer-9)[\\[22\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latinx#cite_note-Gonzalez-22)[\\[23\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latinx#cite_note-Guidebook-23) and first appeared in academic literature \"in a Puerto Rican psychological periodical to challenge the gender binaries encoded in the Spanish language.\"[\\[21\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latinx#cite_note-Salinas_2020-21) Contrarily, it has been claimed that usage of the term \"started in online chat rooms and listservs in the 1990s\" and that its first appearance in academic literature was in the \"Fall 2004 volume of the journal Feministas Unidas\".[\\[24\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latinx#cite_note-24)\n\nI'm leaving the footnotes in because even though the text references \"a Puerto Rican psychological periodical\", the footnote links to a 2020 article and the periodical itself is not named.

As far as I can tell, pretty much everybody is on the same page as far as calling people what they want to be called on an individual level. The problem is with the American media (for example) using Latinx to collectively refer to Latinos\/Hispanics, even though it's *not* the preferred description for *most* Latinos. \n\nI think this is where the virtue signaling comes in. It's not virtue signaling to call someone Latinx if that's what they prefer and they specifically request it, but only 2-3% of people self-identify that way. \n\nIf more people prefer to be called Latino or Hispanic, then it stands to reason *that* should be the word used when addressing them as a collective group, right?   Because as you said, trying to force others not to go by their preferred descriptor is a pretty fucked up thing to do, and that's essentially what the media does when they use the word Latinx to refer to the community as a whole, despite knowing that the majority would prefer to be called something else. \n\nBut again, I think everyone's on the same page regarding respecting other people's individual preferences, though."}

YES cancer, heart disease, all the illnesses a person could get are included in hospital bills. How many choices are due to \"choice\" and how many are due to circumstance (family wealth, place of birth, family values)?? You are making this too simple. It's not just about obesity as a condition that can cause health issues but also all the other conditions that cause health issues. Would you also refuse to help pay into a system that treats a person that self-harmed? Because they were depressed? Maybe they should have personal-responsibilitied themself out of that predicament. Do you think we should pay into the system ONLY for diseases that have litte personal responsibility attached, and also calculate the percent they were responsible so others do not have to pay? YES BIKE PATHS AND SIDEWALKS. My mom was an avid biker and i grew up in a family that valued biking in a very popular city. Others grew up in circumstances that encouraged unhealthy lifestyles. As an unborn, I did NOT choose my mom. We live in a society, and HEALTH in all of its aspects (weight included) is a societal issue. Therefore we should all pay into it... Lets not make it some moral issue about how ppl with unhealthy lifestyles are weak willed and lazy and are punishing the rest of us into paying. I live in Germany currently and pay into a system that gives obese ppl heart medication... but guess what? If I get hit by a car tmr- it will also save me!!

{"text":"&gt;You talk about how leftists wouldn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t call poverty a failure while saying definitively that yes, impoverished whites are failures. \n\nThe reason that impoverished whites are impoverished isn't because of their skin. If you want to obsess about the specific minor terminology you can go ahead, but, again, I don't buy the argument that this is significantly \"alienating\" against leftists because centrists and conservatives explicitly treat poverty as a failure every day. In comparison, I used the term to point out that white people being impoverished isn't because of the color of their skin, and you picked out one word of that statement to argue that I think of poverty as a personal failing.\n\n&gt;To you, there wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t actually in issue with their deplorable rhetoric, the issue was only the target.\n\nYou are getting at the real issue, which is that you didn't like my argument, so you're pretending there was an issue with tone and now you're *making things up* to try to support that argument. Do you see why I don't buy the OP's line of reasoning? You aren't being reasonable, so how exactly can I reason with you? Even if I said everything right and presented everything in the right way, you'd make up something to get upset about and then act like I said it.\n\n&gt;If you can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t see your own hypocrisy or how this shows why the American \u201a\u00c4\u00faleft\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t appealing to the working class, then there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not much point in arguing this.\n\nWho, in your mind, is appealing to the working class?\n\n&gt;Your analogy assumes all poverty among white people stems from an incidental fall (?) which I assume is meant to be analogous to something entirely due to their own doing.\n\nSee, again, just making things up, literally no consideration for what I actually said. It's not even a difficult analogy! There's not a lot of ways to mess it up! I pointed out that black people had an explicit, race-based factor that hampered their success, and the fact that some of them succeeded anyways does not mean that factor doesn't exist. You somehow interpreted this as \"poverty among white people stems from an incidental fall (?)\" which is a statement that *not even you* are claiming to understand. If that's the way you look at things, maybe the problem is on your end.\n\n&gt;Try stepping outside your country sometime, poverty exists elsewhere for reasons beyond being a PoC in a historically apartheid state, try telling left wing groups in those countries that the poor there are simply failures undeserving of help or sympathy.\n\nCounterpoint: *you* should try telling them that white Americans don't have any sort of historical advantages and that their own lives weren't disadvantaged in any way by white people. Then when they point out the imperialism that has ravaged their countries in the past you can call them \"anti-worker\" or whatever it is you think you're doing here."}

Fitness centers and pools were the first to get the axe along with restaurants, but unlike restaurants, we were the last to be allowed to reopen. \n\nHowever, the state didn't get *anyone* processed for unemployment for two and a half of those three months. My entire family - my two sons, their two girlfriends, and myself - all worked at the same place. My home had zero income for nearly three months. We only were able to eat because we had kind friends, family and neighbors who shared what they had, and because my youngest was still technically in high school, so the school gave us food when they could make deliveries after about the first month. \n\nPrior to this, I made a very decent living. We went from \n middle class to nearly homeless in just that 3 months. We lost our home and only found another place to live with one week to go before the sheriff came to put a lock on our door and we would have been living in my car. By the time the unemployment came through, we were too far behind on payments to repair the damage and got evicted. Our landlord had no mercy, the state had no mercy, the judge had no mercy, the sheriff who locked our things inside our house and wouldn't let us finish moving them had no mercy, and I've never been so terrified in all my life for myself and my children.  \n\nTo top things off, the place we worked was a privately owned business, and being shut down for 3 months nearly put the owner under. I lost my job just a couple of weeks after we got the reopen order in June.  It worked out for the best, I ended up in a better position in the long run, but not until October. I was unemployed another 4 months just looking for a job because the only thing I know how to do took the biggest hit of all in my state, and no one was hiring for literally any position, even stores, etc. because of what u\/upinflames26 is talking about in this post - everyone was cutting staff to cut overhead. And I only got the better position where I am now because FIVE people lost theirs and I replaced them all. \n\nI promise you, we weren't over here living it up making a killing on unemployment and just enjoying our \"time off.\" That's yet another story you're hearing from the media to promote division in this wonderful country - the ones who \"got to\" stay home vs the ones who didn't. It's all division here, all the time. Did we get back pay eventually? Sure. Was it a decent amount? I guess. But money can't fix a whole lot of things, and that money couldn't give us back our home or the career I loved with all my heart or my peace of mind. My life was completely shattered in the blink of an eye. That's not \"thriving\" as you worded it. It was literally a living hell. \n\nI sympathize so much with your end of the situation, I thought you'd like to know mine. I know far more people with stories similar to both mine and yours than I do people who made it out of covid ok, either with decent jobs and mental health intact or by getting what they needed from the state while being unemployed. \n\nIt was terrible on both sides of this story, and that's the most true truth I've ever known.\n\nThank you for continuing to work while so many of us couldn't, but given the opportunity, I would have traded places with you in a millisecond.\n\nTL;DR: Shit sucked for us all.

{"text":"&gt;&gt;Not many Democrats want to consider why someone might have voted for Trump, and not doing so increases polarization.\n&gt;\n&gt;This definitely is an issue. Leftists love to talk about how systemic problems contribute to people's ignorance and turbulent life, but don't seem to extend that same understanding to Trumpies or most other right-wingers. I mean, shitty education and being told from birth that the other side of the political aisle is trying to destroy America is gonna fuck your brain up something fierce.\n\nI disagree with this overall point. The democratic party has a lot of issues, I don't deny that. But over the years I've seen so many articles that research, report, and ask the question of why people voted for Trump. I'd argue a lot of democrats *do* or *did* want to consider why someone voted for Trump. The *New York Times* and *Washington Post* had so many stories on that very thing that they could probably fill a 200+ page book. Lots of political scholars spent the past four years asking and answering that question. A lot of Democrat representatives tried to reach out to these voters, maybe not enough, but they tried. Biden spent much of his campaign trying to appeal to them in civil ways for unity. So, I think in general this claim that the left doesn't want to consider why someone voted for Trump is bogus.\n\nWhat I *haven't seen* is the inverse. I've never heard of a conservative outlet asking why someone *wouldn't* want to vote for Trump. I've never seen polls in their media asking what non-Trump voters are interested in. And I've never heard a conservative representative asking how they reach the non-Republican voter. The closest to that I think is some younger more centrist representatives talking about how they expand the Republican party or draw in new voters. As far as I know, no conservative outlet asked \"how can Republicans appeal to liberal progressive voters?\" in the same way liberal outlets asked \"how can democrats appeal to conservative Trump voters?\"\n\nI'd love to see evidence to the contrary. I agree that closing the divisions of the US is important and speaking across the aisle could get us moving forward on a lot of issues. It'd be great if representatives of both parties put effort into representing all their constituents, regardless of party. But I've not seen any evidence of that in equal measure."}

{"text":"I think it's YOU who missed the point.\n\nAt least where I live, there's a significant shortage of housing.  There's at least 200,000 more families than there are housing units for them.  People who grew up in this city are often forced to leave due to the cost.\n\nBut underlying that, cost is only the ***symptom***.  High cost is just an output of the housing shortage.  The reason the cost is high is because there are more families that want to live in the city than there are housing units.\n\nIt really doesn't matter how much money you hand to individuals, since that won't create more land.  With 4-6 million people in the greater metro area, which is constrained by water and nature preserves and green belts, there is no more significant tracts of land.\n\nSo no disrespect to all the workers who do all sorts of jobs.  Nothing I said indicates that they shouldn't exist, but there are structural issues here with how you allocate housing.\n\nCertainly you could (I wouldn't advocate it, but you could) socialize all housing in the city.  You'd have to hold a lottery among everyone who wants to live here to see who gets what house, since there aren't enough of them, and then the 10-20% of families that didn't win the lottery would have to leave the area.\n\nOr you could build more houses, but that would require tearing down swaths of existing family neighbourhoods for high density housing (I've advocated for this in the past FYI).  Or maybe you could install housing quotas and mandatory migration policies, etc.\n\nBut nothing about this is specifically TARGETING low income workers.  They're an unfortunate casualty of a housing shortage.\n\nNot sure what I said makes you think that I shit on McDonald's workers.\n\nWhat i was indicating about \"random bros moving into housing\" is that because this city has a 200,000 unit housing shortage, your \"free housing\" would very quickly be innundated with people just wanting to live in the city, regardless of whether they were ever homeless."}
{"text":"Housing is a finite research with a very smooth demand curve. You can't make egalitarian housing without making it very structurally rigid.  As it is, some housing is an order of magnitude \"more desirable\" than other housing.  Trying to smooth out demand so that it's \"fair\" would require a large scale change in how housing is built and developed.\n\nRegarding socialism, etc...  I've read A LOT about the topic.  There's pretty significant differences in opinion across the spectrum.\n\nI just don't believe that bans on \"private property\" are practical.  I'm a fan of the kind of \"socialism\" that helps level inequalities and provides for basic social needs, health care, and a minimum standard of living... in general, but it seems most effective and productive when it's a framework around and within a competitive marketplace.\n\nBut I believe fairly strongly that a ban on private property simply doesn't work, and to do so would require a dystopian authoritarian society.\n\nThere is definitely a school of thought in postmodern socialism that simply eliminating heirarchies and money as a general concept would usher in unbridled cooperation and egalitarianism across the spectrum, but I also don't find this argument terribly convincing.  Frankly, I find it absurd, but its unfair to just make blanket categorization of its proponents as \"stupid\" - perhaps they're just insanely idealistic.\n\nBut I'm happy to chat more with an open mind.  One of the excercises I've used in the past when discussing complex topics is to not only address the OBVIOUS cases, but also address the edge cases and really explore what the actual structure and scope of the rule and prohibitions would look like in order to implement a theoretical system.\n\nFor example, what exactly is \"banned\" when outlawing private property and how do you distinguish it from \"personal property\".\n\nIf I have a house and rent out a bedroom, is that one or the other?\n\nIf I have a tractor for maintaining my veggies, is that one or the other?  At what point does planting veggies on my personal property then transport it into being prohibited private property?  What is the action taken when that happens?\n\nIf I, as a hobby, start to build a tractor, I presume that's allowed.  But if I complete building that tractor and rent it to my neighbour, presumably that's illegal?\n\nHelp me explore the difference between those two things and where exactly that line is.\n\nBecause exploring obvious cases can make it sound trivial.  \"My toothbrush\" vs \"a mega-factory\" is obvious.  They seem like very different things.\n\nBut the practical implementation of it faced by the majority of people on a daily basis is a lot more nuanced than this.  Most cases exist MUCH closer to the edge-case.  And most businesses develop from small \"working in a garage\/single office\" to where they got today in a fairly smooth way.\n\nAs someone who has started multiple businesses, I'm also intrigued exactly how that would work.  I've heard lots of polemic about how there should never be \"owners\" of a business.  But I don't understand how that works with a small enterprise and what it looks like when I bring in a contractor or seasonal worker or the fact that most businesses end up losing money for the first year or three before they figure out their market and are able to return money or value.  What incentive exists for losing money for years, how would it structurally be encouraged?\n\nWe just took an investment because we have a good idea and believe we can improve the market (and society as a proxy), but we wouldn't have been able to fund it ourselves as it requires some significant capital.  I'm unsure how a prohibition on rent-seeking and ownership of private property enables that concept.\n\nI recognize some people kind of \"hand wave\" that away and say \"ok maybe the government has a fund to invest in small companies\", but I'm unsure what incentive there is to actually be successful then and why someone wouldn't just \"start a company\" take some money and then do very little and then report back 2 years later and say \"whoops I failed, gonna try again, more money plz\".\n\nThere are some really significant structural weaknesses to egalitarian approaches to business that I think are possibly intractable.  \n\nFeel free to share what you like."}

{"text":"I do not need to insult you to make my point. Instead, I will address both your concerns: \n\n1- Which part of the verse says you can have sex with children? \n\nThe verse is talking about the Iddah, which is the period between leaving a marriage and starting a new marriage, in which a girl\/woman should not have sex. The Iddah exists merely to eliminate any uncertainties of the lady being pregnant from her old marriage. \n\nSo back to the verse, we can see from [Quran 65:4](https:\/\/quran.com\/65\/4) that it says in all translations something on the lines of \"As for your women past the age of menstruation, in case you do not know, their waiting period is three months, **and those who have not menstruated as well.** \" See link above or any Quran you have. \n\nIf this is not enough, I can show you Tafsir on that verse: [Here](https:\/\/quranx.com\/tafsirs\/65.4) . I prefer to use Tafsir as the writers are often considered more credible in the religion than mere Hadith.\n\nALL of them (even the more respected commenters from back in the day) mention prepubescent children. The most respected Tafsir, that of Ibn Abbas, even mentions:\n\n\" upon which another man asked: \u201a\u00c4\u00faO Messenger of Allah! What about the waiting period of those who do not have menstruation because they are too young?\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 (along with those who have it not) because of young age, their waiting period is three months. \"\n\n2- Sex with slaves?\n\nIn the Quran, slaves are commonly referred to as \"those whom your right hands possess\". Let's see some Quran quotes, shall we? \n\n[Quran 23:1-6](https:\/\/quran.com\/23\/1-6): These are 6 very short verses, and they talk about what a good Muslim should do, and it ends with saying that a good Muslim is one \"who guard their chastity  except with their spouses or their slaves\" \n\n[Quran 70:27-30](https:\/\/quran.com\/70\/27-30) says about the same thing. \n\n[Quran 33:50](https:\/\/quran.com\/33\/50?translations=40,85,18,84,95): \"Prophet, We have made lawful for you the wives whose bride gift you have paid, and any slaves God has assigned to you through war\" \n\n[Here are Tafsirs](https:\/\/quranx.com\/tafsirs\/23.6) on one of these verses, in which numerous writers say:\n\n\" except from their spouses, that is, to their spouses, and what \\[slaves\\] their right hands possess, that is, concubines \" \n\n\" (they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that) meaning, other than a wife or slave girl, (then those are the transgressors.) meaning, aggressors. \" \n\n\" Two categories of women have been excluded from the general command of guarding the private parts: (a) wives, (b) women who are legally in ode's possession, i.e. slave-girls. Thus the verse clearly lays down the law that one is allowed to have sexual relations with one's slave-girl as with one's wife. the basis being possession and not marriage. If marriage had been the condition, the slave-girl also would have been included among the wives, and there was no need to mention them separately.  \"\n\nIf you want Hadith, I can provide you a lot more, but let me show you [this one](https:\/\/quranx.com\/Hadith\/Bukhari\/USC-MSA\/Volume-7\/Book-62\/Hadith-137\/) for instance, from Sahih Bukhari:\n\n\" We got female captives in the war booty and we used to do coitus interruptus with them. So we asked Allah's Messenger (\u00d4\u2211\u222b) about it and he said, \"Do you really do that?\" repeating the question thrice, \"There is no soul that is destined to exist but will come into existence, till the Day of Resurrection.\" \"\n\nThere are also plenty Hadith which talk about one of the prophet's slaves, Mary\/Mariyah, who he had intercourse with and even upset his other wives for that very reason. \n\nIf you choose to reply, please reply in a civilized manner. I am willing to discuss this further."}

Muhammad is always perfect because he dealt with the conditions of his time in a perfectly moral way. The problem here is that you seem to believe conditions for society are always static. If the average life expectancy was like 30 1400 years ago, it's perfectly rational to marry as early as possible. Saying we don't follow that today is not an admission to his lack of perfection, but a basic understanding of human development and history. Condemning him for this action is evidence of a lack of education. And anyone who claims this is \"subjective morality\" is even dumber.\n\n\nThis is from the links"}

{"text":"&gt; Western countries who ar responsible for most of the wars that killed millions decided to form a country for jewish people in where all the arabs live after destroying ottomans and dividing it into 100 pieces? \n\nIsrael wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t formed because of the Holocaust.  Jews began buying and working the land 40 years prior.  The San Remo conference in 1922 agreed with the need for a Jewish state.  Things were already moving in the direction of statehood after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, but he Holocaust definitely sped the process up a lot.\n\n&gt; Reason is, because it says so in a book from 3 millenia \n\nZionism (the political philosophy that Jews need to have self-determination) is a secular movement.  The first immigrants to the region were communists.  They built kibbutzim, which are literally communes.  The reason why the region was targeted by Zionists as opposed to Uganda or an oblast in Siberia is because Jews see Judea and Samaria as their homeland.  While the origin story is religious, there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no disputing the historical records from thousands of years ago that Jews lived in what they considered to be their homeland.\n\n \n&gt; why not to have a satelite state to control most of the oil. \n\nThe British had newly formed states of Jordan and Iraq to support that endeavor.  After all, there is little to no oil in Israel.\n\n\n&gt; Do you think the story starts fair? The whole story starts with invasions and unfairness. \n\nBased on the above, your depiction isn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t fair because it leaves out much of the history.\n\n&gt; Secondly what would you do if you are surrounded by a country aggresively growing since it has been formed \n\nWho exactly is surrounded here?  In 1948, Israel was invaded by Lebanon and Syria to the north, Iraq and Jordan to the east, and Egypt to the south and west.  \n\nAs far as aggressively growing, have you seen the map of Israel in 1968?  They controlled the entire Sinai peninsula and yet somehow that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s no longer part of Israel anymore.  It has literally traded land for peace and kept it.  It even unilaterally withdrew from Gaza.  Even your use of the term \u201a\u00c4\u00faaggression\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 is unjustified considering how Egypt blockaded the Straits of Tiran, amassed its troops at Israel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s border, and making statements akin to \u201a\u00c4\u00fafight me bro!\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\n\n &gt; blocking land and water,\n\nThe aquifers all start in Judea and Samaria.  Palestine has refused international aide to set up an independent water system.  The Oslo Agreement set out parameters for Israel to provide a certain amount of water to Palestine, and to the best of my knowledge, they have.  The amount in 1993 is most likely inadequate in 2021, but that would have to be negotiated to be changed.\n\n&gt; gets billions of dollar from abroad in a yearly basis, and always behind most of the wars that has been started by israel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s best friend and financier usa. \n\nPrior to 1967, Israel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s best friend was France.  The US didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t support it.  After 67, the US began supporting it  as a proxy war against the Soviets, who were supporting all of the Arab nations surrounding Israel.  Things were relatively level until the USSR began to collapse in the 80s.\n\nOh, and those billions of dollars in aid from the US?  Egypt also gets a billion or two per year.  It all started because of the 55 Crisis and the 67 and 73 wars, which created major instability around the Suez Canal.  The aid was used to stop the fighting so that a critical trade route would be safe.  Though Israel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s share has increased more than Egypt\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s, most of the money they receive must be used to buy US military equipment.  From what I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve read, the aid package is controversial in Israel as well.\n\nAs for the billions in international aid, Palestine receives its fair share as well.  How it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s distributed is unclear, but I would suspect there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s major corruption considering the fact that Arafat died a billionaire and Abbas\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 worth is in the hundreds of millions.  They could\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve used that to build power and water infrastructure, but instead chose to stay dependent on Israel\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s utilities.\n\n&gt; These statements do not condone people living in israel, but it is a sincere criticism of the world\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s attitude towards middle east. They invade kill, steal and form governments at their will and people criticizing are called racists.\n\nCriticism is ok.  The baseless attacks I listed previously aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t criticism.  They are racism because they show a lack of understanding, a lack of desire to understand, and a complete willingness to pile on one country despite many other similar events\/policies among the international community."}

This law seems to be a \"gap-filler\" law, for instances where something that happens sexually should be a crime, but isn't currently covered under the current definition. For example, under NY law today, it's not a crime to take your condom off in the middle of sex without your partner knowing. Under this law, that would definitely be a crime, and a woman who had been subjected to that may very well report it. On the other hand, would somebody lying about being married before having sex *technically* be covered by the law? Yes, but many people would either never find out, or never report that as a crime.\n\n2) And for the people who choose to report their partner's lie in that instance? Prosecutors will filter those reports out. Do you honestly think that any prosecutor would choose to prosecute a case against someone who cheated on their wife? Or who lied to their partner about being out of town, or having a cat, or literally any trivial thing that people lie about?

I am against casual sex. So is FDS.\n\nI am not a savior. I am not telling men what they can and cannot do. I am merely showing what men report about porn vs satisfaction.\n\nI know correlation vs causation. While it might be true that porn comes after satisfaction rather than before, it's an ineffective badn aid at best by deductive reasoning. Let me explain.\n\n60% of men have real sex. 80% use porn. Close enough estimates according to data around here. Even if we assume every man who doesn't have sex uses porn, 40% of men who use porn are having real sex. And they are still on average less satisfied than the 20% of men who use no porn. There is no reasonable way that these men having sex are STILL less satisfied than other relationship people men, after porn improves their condition in any way. You seem to be implying this possibility, but the percentages really don't make it look likely for you. At all. Hence my non-arbitrary assumption.\n\nYou think I'm making arbitrary things up to suit me? Try this on. Let's say the 40% of men are dissatisfied with their sex lives first before they turn to porn. That's 2\/3 of relationshipped men. It's still a problem worth talking about, and that's IF porn isn't totally causal. You do what you want. My point is to be aware of possible consequences, and to also just admit the dissatisfaction in the first place. 2\/3 of relationshipped men shouldn't have to sweep it under the rug and put a porn band aid on it. The stats speak for themselves. But by all means if you want to Jack off how you want without thinking of the consequences or your predicament, of course that's your right."}

She doesn\u2019t improve herself to become Stacy, she\u2019s just willing to give it up sooner to get Chad. \n\nIf porn and other outlets are taken away, this could be really good or really bad in the grand scheme. \n\nGood: Chad may be more likely to commit to Stacy early which \u201cvirtually\u201d removes him from the market. Women wouldn\u2019t have access to chad and therefore are regulated to their league in terms to dating prospects much sooner. I think women will be faced with the reality of average guy at 22 or nothing rather than chasing chad and settling down the line.\n\nBad: The world implodes."}

If you die from lung cancer because you couldn\u2019t get treatment you can\u2019t come back to life.\n\nThe reason a man can\u2019t get an abortion is because he can\u2019t get pregnant but he is already aware of this reality BEFORE he ever had sex therefore it\u2019s his problem not a woman\u2019s. Every person is responsible for their own body. A man needs to do what he can with his own body to avoid having a child. Period.

At least with talking to people in real life I do think that you can make a lot of improvement in terms of small talk ability, charisma, being outgoing etc. Theres really very little room to make any improvements on dating apps."}

I do not care if a woman wants kids or not because it will never reach that point if she doesn't treat me well. I will move on to a woman who does treat me well. If she is putting on an act, committed or not, when she drops the act, I will drop her. That is the point I was trying to make.

{"text":"Would these men really want to be with women who aren\u2019t sexually attracted to them? Sounds like a recipe for a miserable sex life. Hard work and reliability are a dime a dozen among the men a woman can choose from when looking for an LTR. Every man I\u2019ve dated had those qualities, they weren\u2019t rare. We didn\u2019t work because they relied on those things to carry them and not actually being compatible. Like interests, life goals, life style, argument style\/conflict management. The things you list are pretty much baseline requirements. Being sexually successful isn\u2019t the same as landing a LTR. Who those women are now versus who they are in college aren\u2019t the same. I liked to fuck around in college too because I didn\u2019t want an LTR. What I would fuck for fun and who I would LTR are wildly different people as they serve different purposes.

It doesn\u2019t make you special it makes you in the pool of people I would even consider. It\u2019s the above and beyond that makes someone compatible and worth while. There\u2019s no motivation for a woman to be with a man she isn\u2019t attracted to just because he\u2019s hardworking and reliable.

{"text":"Okay, how does any of that make you a decent person to be around from a woman\u2019s perspective? Great, you\u2019ve managed to reach the bare minimum requirements for adulthood - schooling, job, exercise, and you brush your teeth. You aren\u2019t owed a partner because you do those things.\n\nAre you funny? Are you compassionate? Are you empathetic? Can you carry on a conversation? Do you prioritize your passions? Are you generally pleasant to be around? If you were a woman, would you be interested in a man who works his life away and has zero time to enjoy it? What\u2019s the point of making &gt;6 figures if you never have time to spend it?\n\nConsider too that most women work similar hours and are just as lonely. Maybe not in Ivy League career paths or whatever classist standard you want to apply to employment, but 70 hours a week is 70 hours a week no matter which way it\u2019s sliced. I attempted to start a sex doll rental company back in 2018, and while it ultimately failed, one of the pieces of data we gleaned from all our research is that the majority of people, men and women, are lonely. The sex toy business wouldn\u2019t be booming if it were otherwise. \n\nIn your case, maybe consider how important it is that you spend so much time at work. For what, so you can enjoy the last third of your life after retirement wrinkled and bitter? No one ever looks back on their life and wishes they worked more. If your job is slowly killing you, consider downgrading certain aspects of your life so you don\u2019t have to trade your most valuable and precious resource, time, for something as ultimately pointless as a paycheque. You sound miserable, and I empathize, however you are ultimately in control of all the factors you listed. The first to arrive and the last to leave are never immortalized my dude.

My point is that women (making a generalization about the behavior of women as a population, not talking about individual women here) are more likely to ignore the boring doormat and pick someone interesting instead, and that means that being a boring doormat is worse than being a literal murderer when you look at the results both obtain."}

People don\u2019t like picturing the fact that women really can\u2019t just pull themselves up by their bootstraps to defend themselves against men with a few hours in the gym a week.  And it\u2019s even funnier from RP guys who supposedly lift and should, at the gym, regularly see just how much easier it is for them to make gains.\n\nWomen *do* [occasionally win fights against men](https:\/\/www.wave3.com\/story\/7051831\/oregon-woman-kills-hitman-hired-by-her-husband\/), but it\u2019s not something to count on.\n\nAnd granted, men also I think tend to overestimate their own chances in a fight\u2014 even with equal strength and size, you\u2019ll probably loose if the other guy surprises you, hits you first, is meaner and more determined, has more fighting experience (which is different from martial arts training), has more training, has a weapon, or has buddies.  No, you\u2019re not likely to Chuck Norris your way out of a fight with more than one dude even with training: numbers are a huge huge advantage.\n\nBut I actually disagree with you that a firearm is helpful for how women are often attacked.  Think about this: if a man is going to rape you, when is the right time to shoot him?  The gun is a very effective self-defense tool if he\u2019s more than 10 feet away\u2026 but you usually don\u2019t know he\u2019s a rapist at that point, since strange men hanging out in bushes really is the a pretty rare form of rape. Usually it\u2019s someone you know and possibly trust. Remember, if you shoot someone who isn\u2019t assaulting you, you\u2019ll go to jail, where you\u2019ll probably be raped anyways. So, you\u2019ve gotta wait until you\u2019re pretty sure the guy is really going to rape you\u2026 but at that point, he\u2019s close enough to be able to wrestle the gun away, which we\u2019ve already agreed is really likely due to his superior strength. And that\u2019s not to mention you probably also don\u2019t have the gun easily accessible in your bra on a date anyways.\n\nTo me, it doesn\u2019t seem like a gun is a solution to rape often at all.  Like, the only scenario I can think of where it\u2019s helpful is in the case of a woman living alone with a home intruder rapist where she hears him break in and has time to grab the gun before he gets in the room.  So\u2026 only very rarely helpful, compared to the prevalence of rape.  And definitely not helpful for the majority of rapes: rape by trusted family member or friend, rape by an authority figure or via blackmail\/coercion, prison rape, rape when you\u2019re intoxicated or when he\u2019s drugged you, date rape where he just ignores the word \u201cno\u201d, rape of a minor who can\u2019t carry a gun legacy anyways."}

Camgirls and OnlyFans workers are not putting out pictures and videos willfully trying to harm anybody. 2) Nobody forced the drug seeker to purchase drugs in the first place and drug seeker has ample amount of resources both medical and support groups that they can use.

I didn't understand my own eating disorder at the time so I didn't know how to help somebody else but I tried to tell him that he was always an attractive person to me. And we've known each other since we were 5\/6. Like, I always had a crush on him even during our chubby puberty\/acne stages.\n\n\nIn the end, he chose to be self destructive and find validation through cheating. His current wife has no idea as far as I know how often he bragged about his side pieces years after we dated. And I know women who've done the same too.\n\n\nAs someone whose been on both sides of the spectrum of fat, it sucks for everyone.

I'm not trying to say all women have it easy, or that no woman ever has or had a problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;There\u2019s wgtow, femcels and forever some women too. There\u2019s also plenty of women who complain about being perpetually single and not attracting any men\n\nSure there are. But how many men are incels\/mgtow\/forever alone compared to these women? A LOT MORE. And this difference in numbers is an indicative of all the stuff I was talking about. From this statistics we can form a generalization that \"men have it harder in attraction\/dating scene than women\".\n\nIt is simply an undeniable fact. You have evidence all around you\n\n&gt;It cuts both ways.\n\nYes, but it cuts deeper for men. Search up the term \"male disposability\". Men are inherently treated as low value and have to build their value their whole life. Women are treated as inherently valuable and don't have to try as hard as men have to, to prove their \"worth\". Women get judged harshly on looks. Men do too. But you know what men get judged on too? Their jobs and their earning potential. Most women wouldn't date a man that works as burger flipper in McDonald's and can't afford to pay his rent so he's forced to live with parents (unless he's extremely good looking), it's repulsive to them. But as a girl working in McDonald's you have a \"pass\" and your job doesn't matter to men, lot of men will be willing to move you in with them and take care of you.... men don't have that luxury, they have to take care of themselves and must gain valuable skills to get more pay in order to be considered for a relationship. For women, having an unskilled and low paid job is not a deal breaker like it is for men.\n\nAnother example  is to explain this by the \"tribe wars\". When two tribes fight and one tribe gets destroyed, and 100 women and 1 men survive, they have no problem to repopulate in no time because the man can have sex with different women each day. So it's like for each man, there is 50 women. If the numbers are flipped and 100 men and 1 woman survive, the tribe is fucked, because a woman can only have 1 baby in 9 months."}

{"text":"&gt;Almost all men watch porn even the ones having sex so it can\u2019t be porn. Also porn is part of the casual sex revolutions anyways, a more traditional society would ban porn. Porn stars don\u2019t have sex with incels. They get paid to have sex it\u2019s transactional.\n\nI know that men that are having sex are watching pron. I specifically said a porn addict which is completely different forn the average viewer and even then a guy still might have had sex or is having sex. But just because every guy who is a porn addict is not sexless, it's still a major contributor because the guys watching porn constant especially with masturabtuon is thinking that hes having sex with 10\/10 women every session even though he isnt. It's kinda of like hes tricking his brain into think he's having sex with real women. There are studies on this. \n\n&gt;And everyone has different standards in dating. That\u2019s my point. You keep acting like every man can be in the alpha position, by definition that is impossible. Of course there is a more attractive man than you out there willing to have sex with a woman you are interested. That\u2019s how sex works men compete for women. So men leverage provision in order to compete. Men choose to invest more into the women they desire so that those women will select them over a possibly more attractive dude who is not willing to invest. This is how most men are able to have sex or relationships. Even a man who sleeps with hookers is doing this because hookers sleep with some dudes \u201cfor free\u201d while making others pay. The main issue with hookers is they are promiscuous and so they are a very unsafe bet for men. If a hooker has 10-12 partners a week the chances that you fathered her child are pretty low. This is why men prefer to have a woman that is only sleeping with them and not a hooker. The deal he gets by being in a relationship is exclusivity. A hooker is definitely sleeping with way more guys than your wife or gf, in fact most people men and women don\u2019t cheat in relationships so it\u2019s safe to say she\u2019s only with you.\n\nAgain, I discussed the different standards point extensively in my other posts, so I dont want to go over it again here. Yea the hooker can be unsafe, but so can the \"hot\" guys your having sex with immediately. The main issue with these men is that they are probably promiscuous and are hooking up with multiple women a week so having sex on the first date can be unsafe. And they have multiple women chasing them so if he gets you pregnant its highly  unlikely that he will stay around to take care of the child. And yes it would be good to have exclusively with a woman, but a guy shouldn't be so desperate that he would accept exclusivity for any woman. And the reason I brought up cheating is to show you how men and women have differing standards for causal sex..... I know most people aren't cheating."}

{"text":"I don't deny that more and more people are using dating apps. I met my partner on a dating app.\n\nMy point is people who are successfully using those dating apps have a background of talking to people and making friends in real life. They went to school and found a group--however small it may be--that shared their interest they could laugh and BS with on a daily basis. They went to work and found a coworker or two they can talk about TV\/music\/the game with for a few minutes every day. They joined a dance class on Wednesday night and found buddies they could catch up with every week and maybe have a group dinner with every month.\n\nThen, when it comes time for them to find a date, they're able to open an app and not take it so dang seriously because they have enough people in their daily lives to keep them grounded. And they use their real-life social experiences to create a more attractive version of themselves for the people on the other side.\n\nThe people who are \"doomed\" with dating apps have cultivated their entire social background trading message board posts with the exact same type of internet lifers (\\*ahem\\* nerdy men). They open these apps and have absolutely no idea how to relate to the women on the other side. And the only people they can turn to with their struggles are other men with the exact same problems. There's a negative feedback loop that creates a miserable image of social media because some people abuse the tools before they're ready to use them. \n\nYou're (not you specifically) not failing because women are dead set on seeking the best of the best of their \"endless options\" (source: I'm by no means the best at anything).

I understand it's rude and I wish I was a robot that could spit out unemotional answers to each man about whether or not I like him immediately. It is very intimidating to be around men I don't know and for some women, like me, that energy on it's own makes it very easy for men to manipulate and pressure me because my brain is going into fight or flight mode and one of those modes is \"fawn mode\" where you become desperate to people please. which as you can imagine is extremely fucked and dangerous. \ud83e\udd70\n\nGetting off OLD and not accepting walk dates and other low effort date offers reduces the number of men who are soliciting me for sex and or dating to a number that I can actually contend with both vetting wise and with going through the work of ensuring we are always in a situation where I am confident in my ability to keep myself safe. When I was on OLD depending on how much work I put into it this was a couple a day plus dealing with catcalls or men when i'm out. Now, I just as a rule am not available to men and then the decision is made and it's a lot easier to not notice or get triggered by harassment. I feel like you should like that because this means men don't have to change their behavior! That mental energy can be put to better uses. Now, I would go on a date w a guy I was interested in getting to know who asked, but I am going to make him go at my pace so that I know I am always comfortable with him as we get to know each other. I feel if he really wants a relationship with a woman, he would feel this is fine. I'm not talking about waiting until marriage. \ud83d\ude02 But my primary focus right now is not on men or dating, it is on self-improvement and building my life, my wealth, my health, etc. Which, again, if the guy was really interested in a relationship with me, he would appreciate. That is for him, also. He gets to have a way better partner who is a cool person, not a pick me.\n\nIt's hard to say if I will have to be more available to meet men doing this bc it's been since june, so the pandemic.

I'm comfortable with leading a conversation without going overboard, with making suggestions seem reasonable and natural, with leading. \n\nBut I never see *feminine.* I can only even remember one woman who got remotely close.\n\nFact is, the men that don't 'play games' don't get dates. I would know. I learned how to play games. I hate it, but that only means I *stopped* dating, it doesn't mean I *can't.*\n\nBut let's focus on what you said: feminine attracts masculine. This is true. But you didn't go far enough. \n\nFeminine *creates* masculine. But ladies today don't know what feminine is, because it goes against everything they were taught.\n\n[Feminine is uncritical.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YG52Bd9j-dc) It is praising of men. Publicly, respectfully, with acceptance, investment, sacrifice, and enthusiasm. \n\nAnd women *rarely do this.* Unless the man is the absolute highest tier already, it's an invisible world to men. Oh, we can get it maybe if we're just *that* good at the masculine part; those boys can melt a woman into temporary femininity. But that's rare as hell too, as you pointed out.\n\nHard truth: women are the gatekeepers for most men. Unless we *play games,* we have no *leverage* to elicit femininity.\n\nMost of the things that men would do to create that sensation are things that are ill-spoken-of or even illegal. Harrassment, misandry, and more bad words.\n\nSo  [ChillxWithxZaza](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/ChillxWithxZaza\/), I'm going to disagree with you now. It's not on us men to make this happen. It's on you.\n\nI'm gonna be real here. If you aren't doing public respectful accepting invested sacrificial and enthusiastic feminine praise right out the gate, you don't *deserve* masculine. If you're critical, judgemental, or even just too shy to speak up and make yourself vulnerable by praising and endorsing, *from the very first moment,* you are not feminine and you are not attracting masculine. You are even *suppressing* masculine.\n\nThat last part is especially true. Because men are not praised by women. They are not seen as desirable until their wallets overflow, and OP demonstrates why that is *too goddamned late* to be feminine to a man.\n\nAnd the laws of the land and our culture and society is all adding up to prevent men from acting 'above their station'. I.e., masculine.\n\nYou have to open the way. You have to create the space for it, because being masculine may be attractive to you but it's considered a threat by many others. Until you are feminine in all ways from the moment you start considering a man, you will not see the masculine you want.\n\nYou have to take a risk and be vulnerable. But you can, if you do, get a worthy payoff for it. It's on you to decide if the risk is worth the reward."}

So why even talk about it, how about just living your life in peace with the choice you have made? \n\nCould it be that somewhere deep within yourself you agree with me? that there is hope, that thing could change. Still clinging to the truth that this bullshit is true in some sense yet myopic and ultimately self destructive? That maybe there's a bunch of things you could realistically fix\/improve in order to get what you want?\n\nI have sympathy for you man, I have been there, I truly hope you find it in yourself to just fucking get a grip and get some positivity about yourself and dating.\n\nLets end it with a question. Is there at least 10 decent women who fit your criteria living in your city? Could you get them if you worked on your approach and self confidence? If so then why the hell would you let that go?"}

Thought it was a genuine friendship and even told the guy I was in highschool. He watched what stop I got off on.\n\nSo, we chat, turns out he's not in highschool, he's like 21. He asks if I have a boyfriend and then threatens to beat him up if he ever cheated. Kept asking to meet up. Skeeved me out but didn't know how to stop talking to him without being rude so I said I was busy helping with the family garage sale.\n\nDude went to every garage sale in the area he saw me get off the bus stop at. He found my house btw, but thankfully I wasn't home. He asked my grandpa if I lived there and he confirmed it not thinking about if this guy had good intentions or not.\n\nHe found also found out my kind rejection was a lie and started to get more aggressive. Again, I was 16 and completely taken back on how or why this guy insists I need a 'nice guy' like him to watch out for me and protect me from douchebags like my boyfriend. \n\nIn the end, I got my boyfriend, also in highschool, to threaten the guy who to back off. Because I know my ultra religious parents who already monitored everything I did would blame me and probably cut off the last remnants of my social life in highschool if they found out I was kind to a stranger.\n\nAfter that, my car kept getting egged and scratched up, tires punctured sporadically. Like, I've been harrassed. Asking for favours isn't harrassment.

What about ugly men who most people aren't attracted to. Do you think they'd rather be tossed aside, ignored, treated badly due to their looks, than be treated like actual human beings regardless of whether others want to fuck them or not? I think a lot of bitterness in incel communities for example, stem from the fact that they feel both other men and women in general alike treat them as \"subhumans\". \n\nOf course, we'd all rather be attractive, regardless of our gender and sexuality.

I don't want to be around that type of person either, regardless of whether they treat me well. That is me, and probably a lot of other human beings. I don't mean to imply moral superiority, this doesn't make me a better person necessarily. I just want to be friends with people and be there for them regardless of their sex and sexuality.

Look at examples with pedophiles a lot of them are wired that way usually because of things like molestation when they were a kid and it isn't really something they are able to control (trying to change pedophiles is usually a lost cause from the studies I have read), but we still punish them whenever they go after kids and society hates them for good reason."}

There isn't a need to insult the way i talk on the internet , i haven't insulted you .\n\n&gt;\nEvery man puts effort into getting pussy. Thats normal not an addiction. Whats abnormal is being a defeatist and projecting it into others. Stay miserable if you want to, the rest of us are doing something about it.\n\nSo spending thousands on some pussy is normal ?

The only thing you can do about it is either being a beta provider or nothing.\n\n&gt;No, they are not interested in girls, and they dont want to be single. The ones that dont use social media are dating average men already, but you would only know that if you logged off the internet and actually went out. So if they all logged off social media , things would improve significantly. But of course your loser mindset is not gonna accept it.

If i had never interacted with people i wouldn't of stumbled into content about how to attract women or thought about any of that stuff.\n\n&gt;I meet plenty of different people from different backgrounds, and they naturaly pair up with people of the same level, the only people who refuse to do that are entitled girls who delude themsleves into thinking that they deserve the top picks. Usually due to social media and their friends being yes-girls and simps who feed into their delusions.\n\nTrue there are quite a bit of people who only want top picks.\n\n&gt;There are enough of them , for it to be a problem, but its far from all of them. Which is why current gameplan would be for men to improve as much as they can, and try until they succeed. Like i said, if you live in a bad place, change locations. You will find somewhere where there are girls who are looking for a regular guy. But it will take effort. It wont work if you already assume it to be a lost cause. They wont come to you, you have to find them.\n\nThe \" just travel somewhere else\" won't help the teenaged by who's struggling with girls he likes. Not everyone can put down thousands on another home just for the hope to get women. \nYeah i know it takes effort but because of circumstances if i can't succeed with American girls i wouldn't be able to move.

That's where that plethora of choice women have comes in. So is the average guy going to have a chance with this woman?\n\n&gt;\"Men here chase bimbos because they want submissive sex kittens, but when those girls turn out to not be the fantasy dream girl they thought, these guys become bitter.\"\n\n2) This is a classic strawman argument. You're using the worst case possible as though its the norm. Typically guys are going after \"regular\" girls they find attractive. What's wrong with mutual attractiveness? \n\n&gt;who gives men instant sexual gratification.\n\n3) This sounds like slut shaming. I thought we didn't do slut shaming hehe. I'm not being totally serious with this but I did think I would point it out. \n\n\nHere's what your argument did. Men don't typically get to experience the level of desire and sexual attraction from their partner that women experience on the regular. https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/myths-desire\/201612\/why-its-important-men-feel-desired\n\nAnd in order to create an example of a woman who does exhibit the level of desire and sexual attraction towards Mr. Regular Guy^TM you have to make her a \"bimbo\", \"sex kitten\" etc. Its telling how much resentment came across towards men wanting to feel desired in a way that women get to experience on the regular. That's entitlement. Its like the rich getting mad the poor are using the same beach they are. That's why they fence them off."}

You sure the guy hasn't escaped from a Prisioner of war camp or something?\n\nI have never seen a 120 lbs woman trying to fight a man who is 240lbs. Detroit must get pretty wild in the weekends, eh?\n\nNo, the world doesn't teach  that women are amazing. Guys dicks and their craving to stick it inside every pussy they see walking by is what makes these weirdos ascribe all sorts of positive qualities to a woman before she has even uttered a single word, and as long as the guy isn't weirdo, he's not assumed to be a loser.\n\nThen again, red pillers."}

So I don't share your optimism about the counterfactual scenario where Trump wasn't the President and don't think that the credit for not being a total moron is undeserved. And that's just on general grounds, he also disliked FDA and regulation unlike Hillary so that sure helped, and who knows how the culture war front would be drawn in that alternate universe, remember when [Pelosi went to hug people in the LA Chinatown](https:\/\/www.nbcbayarea.com\/news\/local\/nancy-pelosi-visits-san-franciscos-chinatown\/2240247\/)? That was when Trump was already pushing hard for vaccines and shortly before the air travel ban, are you sure Hillary wouldn't virtue signal that Covid is no big deal instead?\n\nFinally, here's a hot load of 'tism about Trump and FDA in particular:\n\n---------\n\nHere's Der Spiegel on EU response:\n\n&gt; The contrast is unmistakable. On the one hand, there is the supposedly incompetent Trump administration, which will provide vaccines to 20 million Americans in the next two to three weeks alone. By the end of March, the plan is for around 100 million Americans to have received the two vaccine injections they need.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the other hand, there is the supposedly well-prepared Europeans, who continue to have to wait for a vaccine that was developed in Germany. And who still don\u2019t know exactly how much of the vaccine they will be getting in the coming months.\n&gt;\n&gt; Initially, Germany\u2019s health minister has announced, there will probably only be 400,000 vaccine doses for Germany, with another 11 to 13 million to \nfollow by March -- a fraction of the amount the Americans are getting.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.spiegel.de\/international\/europe\/the-planning-disaster-germany-and-europe-could-fall-short-on-vaccine-supplies-a-3db4702d-ae23-4e85-85b7-20145a898abd\n\nThe article goes into great depth about how Europe is failing horribly relative to the US (not to mention East Asia).\n\nSo why is the US doing so well?\n\nLets go back to 2016. Trump picked Scott Gottlieb for FDA head, heavily criticized at the time. Gottlieb was a big proponent of FDA deregulation and getting drugs to market faster. In particular, faster approvals of generic drugs was a key policy of Trump to reduce drug prices.\n\nNeedless to say, our elites disapproved.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-health-fda-gottlieb-idUSKBN16H2AM\nhttps:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/04\/04\/health\/fda-gottlieb-background-qualifications\/index.html\nhttps:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/04\/15\/us\/politics\/trump-appointees-potential-conflicts.html\n\nGottlieb and others did push deregulation, including of [random silly things](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/food\/2020\/12\/18\/deregulate-frozen-cherry-pie\/).\n\nAround 2019, Trump got interested in vaccines. He wound up passing an [executive order](https:\/\/www.govinfo.gov\/content\/pkg\/FR-2019-09-24\/pdf\/2019-20804.pdf) based on the premise that production and scale matters a lot, efficacy matters less because the goal is herd immunity. The main target of the \nEO was flu vaccines and pharma companies shipping (as the FDA\/CDC requested) small numbers of doses of high efficacy flu vaccines.\n\nAlso from a 2019 report from Trump's Council of Economic Advisers:\n\n&gt; ...innovation to increase the speed of vaccine production is key. Improving vaccine efficacy  alone  will  be  of  little  value in  a pandemic if...the  vaccine  only  becomes  available  after  a  large  number  of  infections  have occurred. Improving efficacy only yields value after greater speed has been achieved.\n\nWith this in mind, come 2020. Starting as early as Feb, Trump was talking about the need for a vaccine.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/remarks-president-trump-press-conference-4\/\n\nIn May (about 4 months after the first vaccine was created!) Trump started getting optimistic about it, suggesting it could be available by year end: \n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/realDonaldTrump\/status\/1260919777301798912\n\nIn May the establishment (FDA officials, the media, etc) was calling Trump a liar for suggesting the vaccine could be ready in 2020:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/coronavirus-live-updates\/2020\/08\/05\/899411652\/fda-adviser-not-realistic-to-expect-a-covid-19-vaccine-in-2020\nhttps:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/trump-promises-coronavirus-vaccine-end-year-experts-tempe%72\/story?id=70712823\nhttps:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/politics\/congress\/coronavirus-whistleblower-bright-issues-stark-vaccine-warning-we-don-t-n1207056\nhttps:\/\/thehill.com\/policy\/healthcare\/public-global-health\/484702-health-official-says-coronavirus-vaccine-will-take-at https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.ca\/entry\/trump-coronavirus-promise_n_5eab2740c5b635cbe76d2097\n\nWhat happened?\n\nCasey Mulligan - the leader of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers - has now provided some insight into what happened:\n\n&gt; I was in the Oval Office with the president and his economic team in February (when COVID-19 cases were beginning to spread).  His staff was worried that the FDA would not be interested in removing any more approval barriers.  But the President was confident, telling us that \u201cI\u2019ve done it before and will do it again \u2026 bring the FDA management in here.\u201d  President Trump initiated his Operation Warp speed, led by HHS, to give many private companies incentives for \u201cspeed and scale\u201d of vaccine production and to give all companies the opportunity for streamlined FDA approval.\n\nhttp:\/\/caseymulligan.blogspot.com\/2020\/12\/how-economics-helped-end-pandemic.html\n\nSo after all this, it looked like Trump - and no other major politician - was actually the right person to handle COVID. He recognized that the bureaucrats at the FDA were the problem and did what he could to get them out of the way. I suspect that no other US politician would have done the same. From what Der Spiegel writes, it appears that no Euro politicians (besides perhaps Boris Johnson) were willing to either."}
{"text":"&gt; You are unironically trying to give the US government credit for signing a contract for vaccine doses during a pandemic, as if that's some unique feat and display of competence.\n\nWell, as you can see it is rather unique seeing that very few governments managed to pull it off somehow.\n\nAnd that was just one thing among many, the one you decided to make your hill to die on because obviously to your very big brain Operation Warp Speed signing a two billion dollar contract in advance didn't facilitate the development of the vaccine, Pfizer gladly signed it because they didn't know how to do business.\n\nBy the way, if you found other, better studies on the projected effects of the AGW on global GDP I'd gladly look at them, so far it's studies I found versus your gut feeling. Which, I don't know, maybe is how you argue with your other inbred relatives, but I have higher standards sweaty."}

You'd like, what, a photo of in-progress genocide? You know that throughout history that's generally not how that has worked, right?\n\nYou know, I don\u2019t have \u201chard evidence\u201d that global warming is taking place aside from data presented to me by the science community, but strangely enough I\u2019m convinced that it\u2019s happening. On the other hand, I haven\u2019t run the modeling myself, so it could be a lie propagated by THE MAN, bro. You know, it\u2019s really easy to believe anything once you\u2019ve decided the gub\u2019mint boogeyman\u2019s after your thoughts because YouTube told you. I remember people like this that I knew in undergrad. They smoked a lot of weed and they also liked to tell me that the government had knowledge about cars that ran on water, but the government DIDN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW. They knew though, man. They weren't sheep. Mainly they liked to trumpet this kind of stuff because then they could act like they knew something that nobody else did. They were a lot of fun. I assume they still are, but I don't know, because no one speaks to them anymore.\n\nYou also provided The Guardian as evidence of lack of proof, when The Guardian has also reported on, at the very least, instances of cultural genocide taking place right now in China. That\u2019s precisely why the ICC wants more evidence of genocide\u2014it doesn\u2019t prosecute cases of cultural genocide, which has all but been proven. Cultural genocide, by the way, is a major part of U.S. genocide against indigenous peoples because, much like colonialism, genocide is a structure and not an event. That means that there are many interlocking processes that go into making genocide, and colonialism, happen. That lesson\u2019s free, by the way, because I feel like providing you some academically refereed information that you\u2019re not going to find in the dark corners of YouTube where you get your \"literature.\" Might as well be a book without a barcode that you got off of a street corner in NYC.\n\nIn addition to The Guardian (which, I know, western outlet, but you used it as evidence to make your point originally), many outlets have reported testimony from many Uyghur people: Democracy Now!, Al Jazeera, etc., but once you start blanket denying any reporting because of perceived biases by ALL organizations you can\u2019t engage in any critical thought. As I\u2019ve said from the beginning, you\u2019ve drawn your line in the sand and dug in, and you won\u2019t engage in any critical thought because you\u2019ve decided you don\u2019t have to\u2014you know the truth, I\u2019m just an idiot Who falls in line and believes what the western media and government tells me. What I\u2019m trying to tell you is of course there\u2019s bias, but there\u2019s bias on both sides and it can be that BOTH sides in this are awful and BOTH sides should be investigated thoroughly.\n\nYou\u2019ve made your argument and you\u2019re sticking to it. Nothing's going to change your mind. You're not open to conversation. But that's because you know what everyone else doesn't. Because you're smarter than everyone else. Because you've seen the light. So you're right, no matter what. If anyone tries to provide any other frame of thought or reference, they should \"fuck off,\" or they're \"not capable of rational thought.\" That\u2019s not how research, conversation, or critical thought work. But hey, if you get to hold onto your little believees and that makes you feel good, then by all means."}

{"text":"Pineapple on pizza is a Canadian invention.  Not Hawaiian.\n\nAs someone who lived in Hawaii for 5 years, I'm not able to speak of what 'mainstream Hawaiian culture' is.  I know substantially more about it than your average white person - but what I do know is that trying to boil down any culture to what you see in a Flintstones cartoon or 90's sitcom is effectively always a bad idea.  We don't say \"Americans are just gas guzzling obese burger hogs\" and think its not offensive.  We don't say \"Japanese people all wear kimono's and bow to each other before emoting like anime people and running for their lives from Godzilla\", and think its not offensive.\n\nSo with the Hawaiian dude, I can understand the frustration of people boiling your culture down to grass skirts and pineapple pizza (which again, the latter is a Canadian thing).  I agree its not cultural appropriation, but it is needlessly offensive.\n\nAlso to the first point about reverse-stealing culture.  It isn't just that white people claimed it was their culture because a white actress wore the hairstyle, its that they then used the fact that they saw it as white culture to further discriminate against black people.  Claiming someone elses culture as your own, then weaponizing it against them is simply vile."}

If your feet really smell after taking your boots off, I recommend some foot powder to kill off odor and fungus. That's usually the cause of stinky feet.\n\n I wear my boots 10 or more hours a day when I'm welding, and they come right off when i'm done, because letting your feet stew in your own sweat makes them stink even more, and can lead to fungus issues."}

Teens there don't really understand racism because they literally hardly have to live with other minorities.\n\n Sweden was pretty good though, I lived in a ghetto in Northern Sweden where I saw more black people than I do back in the states and they were amazing, kind people, had the occasional Swedish loon but you know. People there generally respected them although Sweden is not doing the best job at properly integrating them.

{"text":"It\u2019s hurting their sexual life greatly, but even if it was just a cosmetical surgery, it\u2019s still out of people\u2019s choice, just like how female genital mutilation is ilegall, male mutliation should be illegal too, unless the patient consents to the surgery in which case is perfectly fine. Circumcision was first invented as a way to make boys mastrubate less, and enjoy sex less as a belief, which shouldn\u2019t be forced onto infants because of their parents beliefs, if they want ro get circumcised later on, they are more than welcome to apply to a surgery."}

We call them \"accidents\" instead of collisions. We say the car spun out of control instead of the driver lost control of their car.\n\nIt paints a picture of traffic violence as random and unavoidable, and absolves the drivers of responsibility. It's not uncommon for drivers to hit pedestrians with their cars, and the police will say it was an accident because the sun was in their eyes or something. Even though driving in conditions that impair your vision is illegal and irresponsible, we just sort of wave it away.\n\nWhen a driver runs a red light they are either making a conscious choice to endanger someone else, or they are not paying attention and missing important traffic signals. Either way, saying the car ran the red light absolves the driver of their responsibility to drive safely."}

China doesn\u2019t have democracy, but democracy isn\u2019t needed, political stability is what is needed.\n\nI always saw India as having a democracy that was tied by a few strings, from my view Modi is slowly cutting those strings.

The wealthy basically found a way to sell their stocks and claim it wasn't *actually* a sale because they have a buy-back option so that they don't need to pay taxes, assuming that the value of the stocks appreciate beyond what they received a \"loan\" for.

I also still technically own the houses and you can only take them if I default on my interest payments.\n\nIf those houses go up to $2 million a piece, then I can sell 5 of them and pay you the original sum of $10 million. I also get to keep the original $10 million in cash, and I still have $10 million in real estate at the end of the day in the form of 5 houses worth $2 million. I don't need to pay taxes on the \"loan,\" or the sale of the houses I used to pay you your money back, however, because I can write it off in the form of a loan repayment.\n\nOr, if the prices of the houses drop to $500,000 a piece, then I can just let you take the houses, because it obviously doesn't make sense to pay $10,000,000 for $5,000,000 in real estate, and I don't need to pay taxes on the $10,000,000 loan that you paid me.\n\nBut in neither of those cases do I have to pay taxes on any of that stuff.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nThis is how Elon Musk got away with paying $70k in taxes last year in spite of being the richest man in the world.

Also, the true value is always in the workers, but we as a society praise the bosses so much that we treat workers like replaceable pawns. \n\nNope. Everyone is replaceable, including bosses. How replaceable you are dictates how much you will probably earn. \n\nFor example, you're extremely replaceable. Elon Musk, not so much. \n\n&gt;Elon's researchers and workers created his wealth, and he enjoyed the fruit of taxation when he got bailed out when Tesla was close to bankruptcy.\n\nAnd they probably got handsomely rewarded for it, and they would not have had the opportunity to do so without Elon. \n\nThis \"us-vs-them\" mentality is not only outdated, but completely wrong and should've been forgotten as soon as the Berlin Wall fell. \n\nAlso, I am 100% against bailing out companies, but that's because I believe in capitalism. \n\nSubsidies and bailing out companies is the exact opposite of capitalism; it's government intervention in the economy. \n\n&gt;You probably unironically think you're going to be a billionaire, but you're closer to an English peasant thanking his lord, you donkey.\n\nNope, I do not think so, nor do I aspire to be one, but I'm not a jealous, bitter, entitled, and pathetic human being - like some of you lot - that thinks I deserve something that others have because they put in the work, capital, and risk to achieve it.\n\nI couldn't give less of a shit about inequality.

What you're basically saying is that if facists took over then you'd be happy to start killing American police officers and soldiers,\n\n*Happy?* Absolutely not, and I'm starting to think you're having this conversation in bad faith. The US and several other countrys who fought for freedom when they formed had to take up arms against both the foreign nation and local sympathizers. It's an ugly fact of war on home soil\n\n&gt;and you think you and your buddies with guns could somehow overpower the best equipped military in the world. \n\nNo one here but idiots think they can overpower the US military. But the past several wars have shown us that organized militaries have huge problems fighting against plainclothes civilians using guerilla tactics. And it'd go on and on, until potentially war weariness causes the military to turn on the leaders. There's a reason I said war of attrition in my previous comment. \n\n&gt;Reality is you'd be branded as domestic terrorists and the army would drop bombs on your house.\n\nOf course the state would label people fighting as terrorists. But they'd need to know who everyone was to \"drop bombs on our houses.\" But if you have some new ideas that the US military could've used in Vietnam and Iraq, by all means send them a letter. I'm sure it'll wow them.\n\n&gt;Also if the facists took over then it's likely that millions of american would support them (hence how they took over in the first place) so about half of all the people with guns at home would also be your enemies, so you'd have to start killing your neighbours too.\n\nYes. This literally happened in our war for independence. You're not adding anything new to this topic.\n\n&gt;The best way to stop the facists is to stop voting for them.\n\nI totally agree. That's *literally* why we vote first. Fortunately if the problem grows, we don't have to toss our hands up in the air and say \"Well, we tried!\" and then lay down like a bitch and take whatever we're given"}

{"text":"Maybe because its an exaggeration to say that every amazon warehouse does that and you rarely get the whole story. I work middle management in a non amazon warehouse and everything I've heard about amazon is not that different from the warehouse industry as a whole. \n\nSo here's the thing about how warehouses work. Theres a ton of moving pieces, and everybody has a role to play in making sure the trucks get loaded on time. The people in question are most likely \"pickers.\" Pickers are given a standard amount of pieces they need to pick in a set time. This is their \"rate\" and rates are usually set by an outside company in order to be fair to the workers. The rate is based on what an average worker is capable of picking in a night.\n\n About 1\/3 to 1\/2 of the people that come through a warehouse are going to be physically or mentally incapable of hitting this \"rate\". That's when we start to question if you think the job is right for you. Its perfectly ok if its not, but we aren't going to keep you on if you aren't able to do your fair share of work. Its not fair to the other pickers. Its not charity work. Part of the pickers toolset is a hands-free headset that tells them exactly what items to pick and where they're at. It tracks idle time and performances. So if you're taking an extra break... we know. Now most people that are hitting their rate, we don't really care. But if you're at like 90% of you're rate... we're going to look for where the idle time is. We want you to succeed... it's expensive to hire and train someone. This is where \"bathroom breaks\" come into play. If you're on the floor fucking off, a supervisor will encourage you to get moving. You can't use your phone because you're operating equipment and its an osha violation. But if you go in the bathroom, its free game. So people hide in the bathroom for 20+ minutes at a time and play on their phone on company time. If this is happening once an hour, then ya, you're gonna get written up for taking too many bathroom breaks. \n\nNobody is asking them to piss in bottles. Some guys that are physically incapable of making their rate but really need the job might feel like they need to piss in bottles to make their performance, but if thats the case, the job isn't for them. Nothing wrong with that. I assure you, if any floor lead in any warehouse anywhere catches you pissing in a bottle you'll be suspended. That is 100% not the desired outcome."}

SpaceX and co are just launch providers but they still need NASA money to pay for it.\n\n&gt;spoke up against covid measures so a factory of his could stay open, and just being a cringelord on twitter.\n\nI feel that context is important for this. Other orgs were opening up at the same time and IIRC Tesla Fremont had permission from one or two levels of government but not another that wanted to wait like a week or something. The level that wasn't allowing it to open couldn't or wouldn't give a reason. Did Tesla face any punishment for its? I can't think of anything.\n\n&gt;In the end he is just a billionaire among many, maybe a pioneer of a new age, but he might as well have never existed and technological advancement wouldn't be stunted to any meaningfull extent.\n\nI actually disagree with this. Electric vehicles would probably not have been nearly as popular as they are now. Instead, we would probably have so-called hybrids which while are better, they aren't **that**much better. Additionally, the US would still be feeding ULA for their imaginary rocket to nowhere and extorted by Roscosmos for Soyuz.\n\nThere's a lot to dislike about Musk, but the above are pretty big points for his companies."}

Person #2 supports it with valid or logical reasoning or evidence\n\n5. Both people discuss the points each one has made to come to a logical conclusion.\n\nNow what did you do? You came in with zero thoughts, zero logic and made a statement which you believed to be conclusive that \u201cyour theory doesn\u2019t hold\u201d without providing any reasoning or thought.\n\nYou still up to this moment have provided absolutely nothing to reinforce your side of the discussion, and still refuse to even try and put something out there.\n\nEven an anti-Vaxxer would attempt to present \u201cevidence\u201d whether it be circumstantial, or coincidental to reinforce their opinion, and why they came to have said opinion. You literally are unabated to find (in 3 days) a single point, backed by anything but your gut, as to how you came to your opinion.\n\nBecause the reality is you didn\u2019t use any brain power to come to your opinion. You just decided before hand yours was correct, had zero introspection, and just rolled with it. There are a MILLION valid and fur reasons for somebody to believe Godzilla could easily defeat Kong without breaking a sweat. I don\u2019t agree with all of them, but there are a ton of logical ways you could make that case. But you refuse to try and make your case, because you are incapable. \n\nSo rather than try, you decide \u201cI\u2019ll just say he\u2019s wrong and I\u2019m right, and that\u2019s just the way it is.

You have no argument, just your unsubstantiated opinion. Is your goal truly to have a conversation for 3 days, without any substance, on a subject you clearly have no real thoughts about? What\u2019s the end goal? Your opinion can\u2019t be settled on as being correct, without presenting anything your trying to substantiate. \n\nAnd all over my opinion, which is absolutely non-conclusive and never claimed to be; that Kong stands more of a chance than people give him credit for. You say no. Well why not? Explain your thinking? And if you can\u2019t, then just accept that you had no thinking when you made the comment in the first place. You don\u2019t tell somebody \u201cno you\u2019re wrong\u201d like it\u2019s definitive, without providing any reasoning, and any semblance of your own developed theory. It\u2019s just nonsense. Like arguing with a religious person why god doesn\u2019t exist, and them saying \u201cgods real, because I said so. And god is mysterious, so I have faith he\u2019s real\u201d. Cool, you\u2019re entitled to that opinion, and I don\u2019t care, but why attempt to start a discussion or debate, over something you refuse to substantiate? What\u2019s the goal there? If I say god isn\u2019t real because a,b,c and you say he is, because he just is. What\u2019s the point of inserting yourself into that conversation if you have nothing to add to it?"}

{"text":"There are many people (myself included), that believe dropping the nukes saved lives. Operation downfall (the planned land invasion of the Japanese mainland by allied forces) was a cluster fuck, even on paper, let alone if it had been put into practice. The officially adopted casualty estimates (in the US) gave figures of anywhere from 150,000 casualties (dead, wounded and missing), to over 500,000 casualties. And, that was only the estimate for the US Sixth army, and only for operation Olympic, the first of two major offensives, centred on the southern most island of Kyushu and on the main island around Tokyo respectively. This didn't even include casualties for the navy and Air force in that first operation.\n\nFurther estimates for the entirety of operation downfall give numbers with wild variation, of anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million casualties for the whole war in Japan, just on the allied side. That's not taking into account the distinct possibility that Russia may have decided to launch a land invasion from the north. While this would likely have meant reduced casualties for the allies invading  from the south due to more stretched forces, it could easily have meant another cold War Germany esque situation, with Japan being divided post war between Russia and the western allies (or at least Britain and America). Its difficult to pin a true number of deaths on this, but even Conservative estimates would put the number higher than the death toll of the atomic bombs."}

Rubber and gasoline were rationed because tanks and jeeps needed them, so civilians in the US needed to scrounge enough ration tickets to replace tires or fill up their car.\n\nin Total War, civilians **become** a military asset.

{"text":"\"Just as bad\" is a perfectly fair comparison. I could just as easily say to you:\n\n\"Stop being a Japanese apologist!\n\n\"The Nazis didn't use bayonets to cut off women's breasts (and mock them) or penetrate their genitalia after raping them, or to gouge out a child's eyes after raping the mother. The Nazis didn't hold \"contests\" on how many civilians they could kill, force people to commit incest under threat of death, douse them in kerosene and burn them alive in retaliation for *American* bombings of Japanese positions. Or run an \"experiment\" to put a mother and her child in an oven-hot metal cage to see how long it would take for the mother to stand on her own child to save herself.\"\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Army matched and surpassed the atrocities of the Nazis in terms of cruelty and inventiveness, no question about it. You might want to learn some world history before spouting off things that could be perceived as \"revisionist bullshit\" or push some kind of \"Holocaust was the absolute moral evil without comparison\" narrative. No one is saying Hitler and the Nazis weren't extraordinarily evil. But that kind of evil existed in spades during WW2; even in Europe the Ustase often surpassed the Nazis in terms of absolutely *medieval* methods of killing."}
{"text":"After the nukes were dropped there was [an attempted military coup](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Surrender_of_Japan#Attempted_military_coup_d'%C3%A9tat_(August_12%E2%80%9315)) to prevent the Japanese Emperor from surrendering. \n\n[Here's a Wikipedia page](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Japanese_holdout) regarding other soldiers still fighting the war because they didn't believe the Japanese would ever surrender if any remained alive. Obviously I wasn't talking about tens of thousands of soldiers, but the fact that a man refused to officially surrender until he was relieved by his former commanding officer from 3 decades ago ordered him to is an very stark insight into the mentality of the Japanese population. \n\nNo other peoples fighting in WW2 would almost universally rather have had their children die, even at their own hand needlessly, than surrender. This isn't propaganda, this is a fact that has many, many first hand sources, Japanese and American. The brutality of the fighting in the Pacific, part due to terrain and remote nature of the battle ground, and part due to the Japanese will to fight to the last man, was the worst Americans faced in the war, and possibly in any war they ever fought.\n\nYour theory posed that the Emperor thought about surrender is also un-sourced, and on top of this it's also impossible to prove that he would have save something as dramatic as the nuclear bombs being dropped. The Emperor was all powerful, but the Japanese military was almost completely independent from government oversight as they were answerable only to the Emperor, who almost never commanded directly. There was no evidence that they were ready to give up, and less than a couple of weeks before the bombs were dropped the Japanese government rejected terms of surrender with no counter, and were preparing for an invasion of Japan.\n\nI don't believe you'll find that there are many historians who believe the Japanese would have agreed to an unconditional surrender without an invasion of Japan being undertaken. How long that would have taken is impossible to know. How many more or less Japanese would have died than what happened is impossible to know.\n\nWhat is known is that dropping Nuclear weapons saved American and Allied lives.\n\nListen to Dan Carlin's \"Supernova in the East\" podcast if you want a much better description of the Japanese society of the time. It's very long, but the first episode of it describes in detail the why and how of Japanese society developing the mentality they had during this period fairly well. The first 30 minutes are largely about the last soldier to surrender, and why he held out as long as he did."}

This will reduce the power of corporations (although it may come with a risk of corruption if left to spiral out of control) meaning that they will not be able to control speech (whether their agenda is left or right wing) and that they will be forced to react with quicker speeds to other problems such as with the climate.\r  \n\r  \nI also support the outright ban of non free range farms and put a minimum age of killing for animals (it will differ upon species) I support authoritarian powers to uphold free speech and do things for the environment.

But then the arab conquests of the levant started and hellenized judeans became arabized judeans and after 1300 of muslim rule, became arabs different to their original \"Palestinian origin\". \n\nAlso, this idea that you can't use the bible as a claim that jews own the holy land is very euro centric, because both muslims and jews fiercely believe in a literal bible (or quran or torah you know what i mean). Muslim clerics in arabia (and all over the arab world) admit that the kingdom of Jerusalem is the kingdom of the jews, not the muslims. it's in both the torah and the quran. also in the quran it states that the kingdom of god's chosen (jacob's sons\/jews) will reclaim Jerusalem.

Nobody denies that Israel commits forced evictions. You're viewing the situation in the context that Israel fairly gained the various occupied territory through the war in 67 and subsequent land grabs meanwhile much of the international community considers it illegal and occupied Palestinian territory. So by that logic how can Palestinians be evicted from land they never left because land deeds were sold and redistributed to Israeli citizens during the occupation that Israel claimed was temporary and has held continuously under the guise of national security."}

Zionists of 1948 didn\u2019t mind control the United Nations. The UN made a decision because the refugees had no where to go. And the British sent a ship full of Holocaust survivors away bc of Arab pressure and ultimately they got sent to Germany, which was appalling. And it was appalling to many that the Arabs influenced the British that they shouldn\u2019t go to Israel even tho it was mostly empty. Oh, and also, the whole world didn\u2019t want the Jews so sending them somewhere mostly uninhabited in the middle of the desert seemed like a good answer, since they originated from there anyway. Look what the pride in a homeland has accomplished in just 70 years. You\u2019d never know you were looking at what was once a mostly uninhabitable empty desert.\n\nAlso...Arabs killed Jews in multiple massacres pre 1948. Bc they\u2019re racists. I ask you, have you ever considered what would have happened if all the Arabs in 1948 said ok, we can respect that the mostly empty land is to be shared. . . And didn\u2019t leave and didn\u2019t try to kill all the Jews? Is there anything besides propaganda that suggests the Jews would have attacked them and thrown them out? (The answer to that is no). If the Palestinians stopped bombing Israel and stabbing citizens and terror tunneling under kindergartens to murder Jewish babies and sending fire kites over the borders to burn down crops and trees and residences etc ...would Israel punish them by targeting the source of rockets and this alleged colonialization? No. They\u2019d be like thank god that\u2019s over. If the Palestinians spend their money on power plants and water treatment and schools and stopped bombing Israel and telling them everyone here should die and they\u2019re going to kill them and didn\u2019t keep terrorizing Israelis, do you think the Israelis would bomb these things? No. They\u2019d cheer. It was the Palestinians that would not accept a 97 percent return of land because their solution is to push all the Jews into the sea. It is a little rude that the Israelis push into areas the Palestinians belongs to them, but the Palestinians think the whole place belongs to them and no one else can live there, so.

I'm not going to address every point you've made because you've written a short article and frankly your opinion is unimpressive and not worth discussing any further because it's standard bias Jewish Zionist rhetoric not unlike the Hamas sympathizing Palestinians that purely demonize jews and want to eradicate them completely from the levant. You're quick to bring up the theme of infidels in Islam but quickly rationalize the theme of the chosen people and the ethnocentrism of Judaism's principle texts and the long tradition of both Jewish mystics and Orthodox Jews which make a clear distinction between Jews and non Jews both racially and spiritually.  The context of the chosen people rhetoric you claim to be an accurate representation is not that of traditional or orthodox jews but that of modern protestant Christians and to conflate the two is lazy at best and deceitful at worst\n\nThe world hasn't confronted the obvious and as Judaism becomes reformed and secularized they might not have to but the reality is Judaism and Nazism are two sides of the same spectrum.\n\n the only difference is Nazism was largely nationalistic first and mythological second with the aryan race theory and Judaism is mythological first and nationalistic second as Zionism has evolved. If all of Israel represented the current orthodox\/traditional\/far right community which is not as much a minority as you claim we'd have a serious international issue to say the least. I don't doubt Israel will go through a reformation similar to that of every former colonial western nation and have to confront their history and develop past it to adjust to the modern era and Judaism itself and the fanatics and religious extremist associated with it will be viewed in the same context as slave owners in the case of America after all they are essentially just a hybrid of the Amish and the kkk."}

{"text":"Lot to unpack here, let's start with this:\n\n\\&gt;just be a good slave or soldier and do the bidding of Mohammed. Just be a Christian who serves Mohammed in other words.\n\nConforming to a good social order is the textbook definition of goodness, and following your own whims, delusions and desires is the definition of evil. Freedom has no objective value and like anything else is entirely dependent upon what it is used for. If you use freedom to do the right thing out of your own volition, then you are slightly superior to the man who is forced to do the right thing out of compulsion, but only slightly. And these two are both infinitely, immeasurably and eternally, superior to the man who does evil out of his own volition. The reason freedom has become the chief value of western society is because the west no longer believes in \"good\" and \"evil\".\n\n\\&gt;Individuals are to be cucks ...\n\nThe individual is a schizophrenic fabrication of late enlightenment, unlike what delusional french revolutionaries thought, Man in his natural, ancestral state was never an individual, but always a member of a tribe. Atomized individualism is the very definition of disempowerment, a group of a million enlightened individuals will be cut down by a band of ten thousand men who have put aside their egos in the service of a higher value, they will cut through the individualists like a red hot knife cuts through butter. The individual must be a slave to the laws laid out to protect the community against internal and external threats as long as those laws actually are there to protect a healthy community in a healthy way, so the individual as a concept has very limited usefulness and a very broad range of uselessness. Without this, the community will succumb to those threats in what amounts to a blink of an eye in the grand scheme of history.\n\nOn top of this, after three centuries of rabid individualism being the official state religion of the west, we see no evidence of the enlightened individualistic hero becoming any more common than it was in the dark ages, in fact, they have become rarer! Because the conditions required for an actual heroic individualism only exist in an extremely collectivist society that has been able to establish order and social cohesion to such a level that even the conception of an autonomous individual becomes a possibility.\n\n\\&gt;It is only genuinely based in the oppressing women department\n\nWrong, Islam is right about women, alcohol, hedonism, gays, out-group prejudice being a moral virtue, in-group preference being a moral virtue, self-control being amoral virtue, submission to the truth being superior to submission to falsehood, order being the highest social value, an eye for an eye being just... It is only wrong about cousin fucking and race mixing and that's it. Ban these two and Islam will become the most sophisticated, the most efficient and the most productive mode of societal organization humanity has ever conceived.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;It's not because it's a superior philosophy which explains why women are cringe(like how Aristotle argues about it) or whatever. It's doesn't really have a consistent philosophy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConfusion of the highest orda!\n\nWhat makes you think a rationally constructed philosophy is superior to a faith based philosophy? If that were the case then Aristotelians would have conquered the world not Muslims and Christians, both extremely faith based ideologies. Unlike what the french revolutionaries thought, reason is not man's central capacity, anyone who has lived a single day of their lives in this world knows that statement to be false. Belief rooted in faith prompts a man to action, to necessary sacrifice, to heroism and to all other virtues that Aristotle tried to find a rational basis for, a belief rooted in reason is flimsy, doused in doubt, abandoned at the first sign of trouble.."}

If you want the differences, I (as an American Jew who has traveled to Israel twice and spend a good chunk of time there) can give you that. \n\nThere are three main categories of American Jewish people: Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox. Of course there is massive variance within these sects (specifically orthodox where you have hassidic, modern orthodox, etc), but these are the main categories. Orthodox Jews believe in the Torah and Talmud, etc as the word of god and want to follow that word to a T. Conservative Jews take some pieces of the Torah literally but others as guidelines. And reform Jews take the Torah as something that was written to help us live life well but not something that needs to be followed perfectly. Many reform Jews don\u2019t even believe in God. Again, a mass generalization, but I think that is a fair assessment. Sure, some of us are leftists, but not all. And basically every single Orthodox Jew I know voted for Trump *twice* because he supports Israel. Reform and many conservative Jews support Palestine (at least to some extent), although that is largely motivated by the oppression of Palestinian people by the Israeli government and IDF rather than a dislike of a Jewish state.\n\nNow, in Israel there are basically no Conservative Jews. You have a *large* number of reform Jews who, largely, don\u2019t believe in god and are Jewish mostly in ethnicity. On the other hand, there is another group of Haredim (think strict American Orthodox Jews) who have a stronghold on the Israeli political system and (often) work to enforce strict traditional Jewish law. Interesting, many of the reform Israeli Jews believe in a sort of two-state solution and do not support the oppression of Palestinian people. \n\nHopefully this clears some stuff up. Not every American Jew loves Palestine and hates god and religion and Judaism. Not every Israeli Jew loves Israel, hates Palestine, and loves the US. Happy to answer any questions if you have any.

{"text":"Girl asses might be very wide and thick, but male ass is rounder and fuller(unless it is skinny ass made of nothing but muscle an bones that have those weird dips on the sides). Because male ass is narrower, it can get more muscle and curve from the side. Average good buddy looks like small version of fake oversized women celebrities asses, they have the same shape, but smaller.\n\nAlso the hole is a major reason why bussy is superior, because vagina is very close to butthole, it kinda takes away from the butt, because it distracts you with another additional hole right next to it. Bussy on the other hand has a long patch of skin until it hits the balls that hide the penis when looking from behind. Balls are unpleasant to look at if they are not cold, but the main thing is that patch of skin between anus and ballsack. That patch of skin look perfect, it looks like a puffy pussy that has been sealed off, and has scar like line connecting it that feels great on touch.\n\nThe final reason for bussy to be the best is because of the prostate. Most girls that have done anal didn\u2019t like it, but most men that had been dicked or tried dildo liked it, hence why even straight guys enjoy pegging. Even raped boys often turn gay because of the feeling(I do not promote pedophilia). This great feeling makes the partner more engaged in sex and thus better at it, and his enjoyment will make the sex much better then without.\n\nAll of these facts make it clear that bussy is superior to female ass."}

It's time to come clean.\n\nLet me tell you a little bit about how I go through my day, which is also how literally every other not-children's book reader goes through theirs.\n\nI wake up in my dingy, unwashed bed (which is covered with suspicious stains), then immediately scream for my mother to come downstairs and tell me that I\u2019m a special boy. Once I feel sufficiently better than everyone else, I log in to Reddit, where I go through all of the top-secret communiques that I receive from whichever political party you personally dislike. Having accepted my marching orders, I motivate myself by going to town on my own backside with an anime-style figurine; a doll which looks vaguely like the world leader you most abhor. Then it\u2019s time to get to work.\n\nPushing a narrative which irritates you \u2013 yes, specifically you \u2013 is obviously my first priority\u2026 but if a totalitarian regime which controls another country, religious group, or corporation has sent me enough money, I take whatever steps I can to promote or censor anything that\u2019s even tangentially related to what they\u2019ve highlighted for me. If the entity in question also happens to have a very small minority stake in Reddit (or if one of the site\u2019s executives has rumored ties to their organization), then I make sure to publicly fellate them whilst simultaneously denying their influence. The more sucking that I do, the more cash I receive!\n\nMind you, I don\u2019t actually spend any of that loot, because moving out of my parents\u2019 basement would mean that I wouldn\u2019t get that crack-of-noon ego-stroking anymore. No, rather than using those ill-gotten gains to improve my lot in life, I sculpt them into life-size (and anatomically correct) sculptures \u2013 using copious amounts of my own neck-sweat as glue \u2013 of the various public figures whose actions or perspectives anger you.\n\nAnyway, once I\u2019ve made certain that my corrupt overlords are pleased, I start looking for ways that I can ruin individual users\u2019 days. Randomly removing posts (and then pretending that they were in violation of some invisible rules) is the only way that I can become aroused, after all, and I need to stand at my full, massive two inches if I\u2019m going to be able to reach myself past all of my stomach fat. Having come to attention, I put on my self-pleasure hat \u2013 which is a trilby, of course \u2013 and start banning people who disagree with my opinions.\n\nThose opinions having been carefully structured to go against yours, of course.\n\nIt\u2019s time for a break by that point, so I spend an hour or three lecturing my waifu body-pillow about a given social trend that makes people (again, specifically you) upset. She\u2019ll usually offer some kind of counterargument, which means that I need to throw an impotent tantrum. Whenever that happens, my only solace comes by way of somehow abusing my awesome Internet powers, typically while gorging myself on junk food, soda, and heaping handfuls of straight-up lard. Don\u2019t ask me how that abuse actually manifests, though, because I\u2019ll silence all of the remarkably insightful questions that you send my way. The thing is, I\u2019ve never heard any of them before... and since my hidden masters haven\u2019t told me how to respond, my only option is to screech at my computer monitor as I wildly flail around.\n\nThose eight seconds of exertion tend to bring me pretty close to unconsciousness, so I have to completely ignore the communities that I govern for a while, thereby allowing a multitude of posts and comments to go through unchecked. Fortunately, they\u2019re only ever submissions which you (once more, specifically you) find distasteful, so it still counts as a victory. At the same time, though, if you try to submit anything \u2013 especially if it\u2019s entirely adherent to those invisible rules that I mentioned earlier \u2013 I\u2019ll wheeze my way back into a semi-upright position for just long enough to mete out another completely unwarranted ban.\n\nFinally, once all of that is done, I kill myself, frequently by dying in a fire. Getting the suggestion to do so dozens (or even hundreds) of times a day just proves to be too much for my utterly unfathomable intellect to handle, so I eventually succumb to the sweet embrace of death.\n\nBesides, it\u2019s the only way that I can get to sleep at night.\n\nTL;DR: You don\u2019t need to read this, because you\u2019ve already decided that you know it all."}

And after all imagination for 30\u201340min just started stroking my penis and i also scratched my balls at the same time and this gave me a intense level orgasm.\n\nAnother method i used whenever i took shower i kept my head of penis under shower and when water fall on penis i felt tickling sensation and i loved that but it was not a effective way and yes you need not use you hands in this method.\n\nThen i started using edging technique to get a teasing blowjob i lubed my organ so much massaged that and gave myself teasing masturbation this made me so mad that i didn't open my eyes for one minute when I did cum try this but yes don't forget to tease yourself till 15 min.\n\nAnd now comes my favourite way it makes you feel as if your fucking a vagaina . For this first turn on yourself make your penis fully errect then put your thumb tip on you navel and make a curl from your fingers and try to insert your dick in that curl of your hand and after This try to push and pull your penis from your hips area . Believe me bro. This is the best way i usually tries this whenever i want the feel of a pussy.. and it always gives me a Extreme level pleasure.

The point of your analogy was to claim that, though keeping the ship afloat is a somewhat simple procedure, there are people who are actively working to ensure the ship sinks.\n\nI have to admit, this is a perspective I had previously thought too ridiculous to exist, but actually? It explains why you people are as invested as you are: *just like anti-lockdown people, you too believe you are having to defend yourself against a malevolent group of people who are using the pandemic as an opportunity to harm others*. Whereas anti-lockdown people claim the government is using the virus as an excuse to remove freedoms, you believe a group of anti-vaxxers are conspiring to spread the virus as far as possible, cultivate new strains, and slow medical progress, and quarantine procedures must be enacted by force to stop them. \n\nWhile we still disagree, I do think talking to you was eye-opening."}

While I know you believe they are actively harming others, they are objectively the \"neutral\" position on the issue, whereas pro-quarantine people are the positive and \"pro-covid people\"(hypothetically) are the negative. You are conflating all potential progress not obtained to a net loss; in a race, there's a hell of a difference between not getting 1st place, and crashing into the side of the track and dying.\n\nThe initial stated purpose of quarantine wasn't to flat out prevent people from getting infected, it was to prevent people from getting infected in numbers that exceeded the amount treatable by our healthcare services. Whether or not the goal of flattening the curve was obtained is irrelevant  to the fact that we are past the initial waves, and everybody continuing to row is redundant."}

Honors classes. 60-hour work weeks. Side hustles. Like many Americans, Dr. Devon Price believed that productivity was the best way to measure self-worth. Price was an overachiever from the start, graduating from both college and graduate school early, but that success came at a cost. \n\n&gt;After Price was diagnosed with a severe case of anemia and heart complications from overexertion, they were forced to examine the darker side of all this productivity. Laziness Does Not Exist explores the psychological underpinnings of the \"laziness lie,\" including its origins from the Puritans and how it has continued to proliferate as digital work tools have blurred the boundaries between work and life. \n\n&gt;Using in-depth research, Price explains that people today do far more work than nearly any other humans in history yet most of us often still feel we are not doing enough. Dr. Price offers science-based reassurances that productivity does not determine a person's worth and suggests that the solution to problems of overwork and stress lie in resisting the pressure to do more and instead learn to embrace doing enough. \n\n&gt;Featuring interviews with researchers, consultants, and experiences from real people drowning in too much work, Laziness Does Not Exist encourages us to let go of guilt and become more attuned to our own limitations and needs and resist the pressure to meet outdated societal expectations."}

{"text":"Its not about it being a valid reason, its about supply and demand. You are making a moral argument and the economic principles which govern how businesses work don't care about morality. If you want minimum wage to reflect a higher moral standard, you need to get congress to raise the minimum wage and address the other work issues like scheduling and time between shifts. \n\nWho is going to take those jobs? Well, to be honest, hopefully no body. Either the jobs will get automated and go away since many are shit jobs to begin with, or the wages will rise and become a livable wage job. Again, supply and demand. People refusing to work reduces the demand for that job, increase the demand by raising the wages and improving the working conditions.\n\n&gt; What if someone's natural intelligence and abilities are only suited to less-skilled \/ minimum wage work?  \n\nIf all the people who could be doing more productive work quit the minimum wage ones, the reduced supply or workers would force up the wages for those who can't. A more specific answer however is that even people with limited intelligence or abilities are often able to be more productive than a minimum wage worker in a dead end job. It might however mean they have to move to where those jobs are. So for example, there are jobs in agriculture or involving animals which pay better than minimum wage or at least offer greater personal fulfillment than being a minimum wage slave, but they are not going to be located in a big city or suburb. That person is going to have to choose between staying close to what is now home or moving elsewhere. \n\nI think that fundamentally, your question about those with limited abilities gets to a bigger issue when it comes to labor, economics, and the nature of profit driven business. If due to lack of skill or ability an employee is unable to generate a profit which supports a higher salary, where is the business employing them supposed to get that additional income to pay them that higher salary? Say a company hired a person with Down Syndrome to clean offices at night, but they can only clean one office per shift, as opposed to multiple offices that a competitor can clean in the same amount of time. If their hourly income for that shift exceeds what the competitive market will allow the company to charge for those services, the company will lose money on the contract and that person will end up losing their job. If the company raises the fees, they will likely lose the business to the more efficient competition. Without some sort of subsidy or collective labor action across an entire industry, you can't force one company to raise wages above what is profitable. Look and John Deere. They are hugely profitable, and their workforce is striking because they know the company can afford to pay them more. Conversely, look at childcare. Childcare is already hugely expensive yet many daycares are struggling to fill positions. Why? They can't raise wages hardly at all because if the childcare becomes more expensive than what a working parent can support, it ceases to make economic sense for them to work and they'll just compete with the daycare by providing their own childcare. You can't just ignore supply and demand."}

How did low wage workers, who couldn\u2019t possibly save any money with their wages since big bad managers are so big and bad, build up a savings buffer?

What will people do when aid and savings run out? They\u2019ll return to work. \n\n\u201c\u2018We believe there is a more permanent loss of workers driven by a large number of older workers taking early retirement. The thought of returning to the office and the daily commute may seem unpalatable for many people and with surging equity markets having boosted 401k pension plans, early retirement may seem a very attractive option,\u201d they noted, adding that border closures will have curbed immigration and slower birth rates mean fewer young workers are now entering the workforce.\u2019\u201d\n\nOlder people are retiring as well.

{"text":"&gt; he waited for my next shift to start, he didn't fucking call me at home. \n\nWithout getting too specific I'll share a somewhat relevant anecdote. My mom's job would frequently have situations where employees would get called \"into work\" due to some \"emergency\" that arose. Sometimes it was a bullshit nothing thing and other times it was an actual emergency that required bodies (experienced ones at that).\n\nShe did that job for 35 years and was basically a god in her position by the time she retired. My memory is a bit foggy but at some point she got tired of going out at all hours of the night like a dog. \n\nSo we had a separate phone line *just* for these phone calls. It rang twice so you knew if you heard two rings do NOT pick up the fuckin phone. Anyways somewhere along the line she became the first person on the list to be called for all these emergencies in the entire district. This fuckin phone would ring all the time and this woman never answered it in the 20 years odd years that I can remember.\n\nI guess somewhere in the first half of her 35 years she had gained enough clout that she didn't have to worry about that shit. I always found it hilarious and she would give me some line about \"After I leave the office I ain't doin any more work.\" Although thinking back I definitely remember her getting called after work and telling the person on the other end to call so-and-so or take care of it themselves lol.\n \nBut yeah, I certainly made the mistake multiple times over the years of answering the phone at like 2AM thinking it must be an emergency cause who the fuck is calling my house at 2AM. Except I didn't process the second ring and would end up on the wrong side of a serious phone call. I always had to make up some bullshit about mom being \"unavailable\" (it's fucking 2am!) and the person going down that list would never say anything but I could always tell by their voice that they were totally understanding lol. Cause remember, somebody has to make that phone call at 2am and they certainly aren't too fuckin happy about it either.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk ^^^is ^^^this ^^^still ^^^a ^^^thing?"}

Just because we're not kidnapping people and whipping them doesn't mean it's not slavery in my eyes.\n\nI consider being forced to make a shit wage that forces you to work 60 to 80 hours to cover even the most basic poverty stricken life as being slave labor. Because you can't take any other jobs. You can't go to school. No time. You can't strike or appeal for better working conditions because they can replace you."}

{"text":"As someone who works in healthcare on business side most of the admin costs come from compliance with government regulation.  A lot of it is unnecessary and a waste of money.  True conservatives are of the mindset govt is wasteful and inefficient with $$ which is why they fight tooth and nail from giving govt more money and wanting it privatized.   Not \u201cpay more money for less service\u201d.  Not saying universal healthcare is a bad idea it just has to be done very carefully.  Student loans completely jacked up tuition prices and screwed over young people. The obvious answer isn\u2019t always to just throw money at something. It\u2019s throw money at it but very carefully and with a strategy. Anytime big money is involved with govt corruption seems to follow."}

{"text":"That's in the spending money category. It's doable, but the general theme here is that you're going to have a bad time if you're trying to live off minimum wage. If you're making $8\/hr in America, you are basically a labor robot. \n\nI'm an advocate for substantially raising the national minimum wage, but people in this thread seem to have a certain sense of entitlement about the quality of life they're expecting working a job like this. There are people driving Subarus and Civics talking about how the car payment is all wrong, and people paying close $100 for their monthly phone bill talking about how it's really not possible to go lower and still have a good amount of data. Like, let's be realistic. If you don't want to drown in an ocean of credit card debt, you might need to give up on having that stuff. I'm talking a bare minimum data plan with a terrible phone, a bus pass instead of a car, or if necessary a crappy old car you just have to pray will last you a couple of years, an absolute closet of an apartment (or the many roommates crammed into a larger one), no money for excess things like alcohol, etc. You probably also have a second job, meaning limited free time. Definitely no kids either, or you're in trouble. Your only goal has to be getting a higher paying job as soon as possible.\n\nDoes this sound horrible? Absolutely, yes. Still, this is the reality if you're trying to live within your means while making minimum wage in America. People need to be realistic about this when calling McDonald's out of touch here; this isn't a company's problem, but an issue with the entire system. America systematically exploits its workers so that a narrow slice of the population can make billions. The system absolutely needs to change, but in the meantime, for their own sakes, people need to be more realistic about what they can actually afford on a budget like this. Your options are either living like a wage slave or living outside of your means and ultimately having to live like a wage slave even longer as a result."}

And I feel like a lot of what your talking about is the other guy. Which, he did say he isn't good at debates, I don't think he'll be too fussed if no one else wants to debate him."}

{"text":"If the point of the debate is for a fair exchange of ideas to happen, then why do the identities of the participants matter? Crowder demanded Ethan debate him on the merits of trusting scientists about the safety of the COVID vaccine. Wouldn't an honest actor who has faith in his arguments welcome the opportunity to debate someone who is well informed about this issue rather than pick a drama youtuber who admittedly is neither an experienced debater nor an expert on the issue? Also, Wouldn't someone who wanted a fair exchange of ideas avoid calling the person who they challenged a \"lay up\" and put a ticking clock on the challenge with a threat to withdraw to limit the time their opponent has to prepare?"}

It is on a more ridiculous level though, I'll give him that.\n\nYou really went off the fucking rails with the rest of your comment, I don't like Crowder because he's a disingenuous moron, and attracts even dumber followers who think that being an insufferable tool is the same as being a successful pundit. Are you one of those people?"}

Stop getting your panties in a bunch over the fact that you can't fathom how someone isn't upset by something yet can still comment on it.\n\n&gt;What\u2019s he disingenuous about? \n\nWell, for one, he used his pregnant wife to cover for his cold feet, he only \"debates\" college students with often incorrect or at least heavily skewed statistics, he recreated waterboarding and the George Floyd incident in flawed ways then pretended both those things \"weren't big deals,\" when he started losing a debate during one of his Change My Mind segments, he latched onto one slur used by his opponent and wouldn't continue the conversation past that. Those are just off the top of my head.\n\n&gt;Everything he says is backed by multiple sources that are always listed and linked on his website for every single episode\n\nThere are plenty of things he says on Twitter or on his show or during his \"debates\" that are straight up bullshit. \n\n&gt;can\u2019t say that for basically any of his \u201copponents\u201d\n\nWell no, because he doesn't actually debate any opponents.\n\n&gt;The guy was kicked off YouTube for 2 weeks for quoting the CDC for god sakes because YouTube can\u2019t even update their policies in a timely manner lol\n\nAgain, what the fuck does this have to do with the conversation?\n\n&gt;And I\u2019d say he\u2019s pretty successful\n\nNever said he wasn't. He's not a successful pundit. You somehow took that to mean I said he didn't make money, so yeah....\n\n&gt;he seems to really get under your skin a lot.\n\nYes, lying dumb fucks do that to me. \n\n&gt;Are you just bashing him because you don\u2019t like him or low key defending Ethan?\n\nI'm bashing him because he looks like a tool by cosplaying as Nathan Drake.

Yes, we have been using them all along but how we\u2019ve been using them all along and how your examples just used them is different from how the \u201cnon-binary\u201d crowd use them and expect others to use them. \n\nFurthermore, the pronouns aren\u2019t the thing most people really take issue with, they\u2019re just symptomatic of the larger, stranger issue at hand. \n\nI\u2019m pretty progressive in my political outlook and as a gay man I have no love for the right but we here on the left consistently accuse the right of being science deniers when it comes to things like climate change and yet here we are completely disregarding and ignoring the science on gender and sex.

You gotta find a way to be more inclusive. Like in a sports thread there are plenty of people who mean well but don\u2019t know better.

You figure out what it is, and you stick to it, because it\u2019s who you are. \n\nI don\u2019t think many people today are taking this seriously. \n\nSome ARE.\n\nI know transgender people that are friends, that are actively transitioning, and I take THEM seriously. \n\nBut other people, not so much."}

And random mutts just dont happen as much as you think anymore depending where you live. They're also in demand, believe it or not, because they have a certain \"brand-like\" image to them. That cute little mutt doesnt last long in the shelter. What lasts long is a pit bull types or pit bull mix. In the shelter I worked (one of the largest in the US), if we ever had to euth for space, it was pit bulls at the top of the list because they stick around the longest. So you're probably not actually drastically saving the life of a mutt if you adopt one, unless maybe it's a pit bull mutt. Especially now since covid cleared out adoptable dogs around the country.\n\nDesigner dogs are also technically mutts, but they're known to be extremely unhealthy because most designer dog breeders dont give a shit at all about certifying parent health, before they breed together a cancer retriever with a neurotic poodle. And most people who buy designer dogs, as above, want a cute scruffy \"on-brand\" dog, and they dont know or dont care about what health tests to demand from breeders. \n\nSo, you know.

Men saying a man getting divorced has it worse than a woman getting raped. I can\u2019t tell you how many death and rape threats I\u2019ve received from these fuckers. They\u2019re literally being tracked by hate crime organizations, for goodness sake.\n\nThe whole idea of them just talking about \u201chow come there are no places to go for an abused man\u201d is completely overshadowed by their incessant vitriol about how much they hate women.

Both are done in the name of culture, sexual shaming, reducing pleasure, and aesthetics, just targeted to different genders.

Chances are you don't see MGM as comparable to FGM though, so there's probably one easy case where men are heavily, tragically oppressed yet 1\/3 of the global population disagrees, possibly including you.\n\nI see you've made a lot of comments trashing groups of people that include those actually just fighting for men's equality, had to give you a reality check. e.g. TwoX certainly seems like a place that outright excludes men from the discussion and overall a haven of sexism and toxicity, while at least these men's equality subs are eager for women who have any interest in listening to anything said.

Or if someone said or do something particularly distasteful or stupid, why is it okay to say this is why no one want to sleep with or date them?  Why is the inability to find romantic love\/have sex so far in life treated as a personal failure?\n\nAt the same time, our society glorifies sex and romantic love as the end-all-and-be-all of life.  Sex and romantic relationships are prevalent in most popular media, even in genres that don't need that to work.  They may say you can be happily single. but at the same time treat finding love as the default happy ending.  And even in these \"happily single\" scenarios, more often than not their \"single life\" is dating and having sex casually without staying attached.  I can hardly think of a show or movie where the main character struggled to find love\/sex, and in the end didn't find either, but decided that he\/she can still live a happy and fulfilling life in spite of that.\n\nSo if this is the culture today, then is it any surprise that there are lots of people depressed and angry that they aren't getting romantic love\/sex, and that they feel they are somehow lesser or abnormal for that?  Is it any surprise that contributed to some of them doing the unthinkable?\n\nSo we can demonize these people, say they are bad for what they think, exclude them and ban their place of gathering from Reddit or Facebook.  But I think that until society changes the way it views romantic love and sex and how it views people who don't have either, then the problem won't truly go away.  There will still be lots of people suffering in silence, and occasionally some of them may snap and do something atrocious."}

{"text":"&gt;No three words are going to perfectly capture the positive sentiment necessary to oppose a complex and widespread issue. Complaining about the label is worse than useless.\n\n\"Reform Criminal Justice\"?  \"End Police Brutality\"?  I could workshop some more if you'd like, I'm just firing off the cuff here.  And also assuming I should take people who say that BLM is about stopping mistreatment and abuse of power in the criminal justice system in general (rather than something more explicitly race based) at their word.  Also assuming I'm limited to three words.\n\nLike I can understand why \"Defund the Police\" fails at being sufficiently descriptive, that's a pretty broad topic with lots of nuance (and disagreement) about exactly what it means and how one might go about it.  But imagine instead the slogan for that was \"End White Cops\", that's a decidedly less descriptive motto that also centers it as primarily a race issue in a way that's not helpful to explaining what you are trying to achieve.\n\n&gt;demographic least targeted by discrimination,\n\nAs regards the criminal justice system (at the very least), the race\/gender pairing  least targeted by discrimination would be Asian women, followed by white women.  Depending on the specific stat, either black women or white men have it worse mostly with white men as more likely recipients of violence and severe punishment and black women being more likely to get picked up on nonviolent drug charges or being searched (generally as a lead in to said drug charges).  As regards being killed by police specifically white men are about ten times as likely to die that way as black women.\n\n19\/20 people killed by police are men, men get about 2\/3 longer prison sentences for a given charge, etc, etc, etc.  Virtually any stat you can find regarding how black folks are mistreated by criminal justice relative to white folks has a gap regarding how men are mistreated relative to women in which men receive worse treatment.  And in most cases the gender gap is equal or larger than the race gap.  It just goes the wrong way to be considered a problem worthy of consideration.\n\nYou don't think it's a bit \"weird\" that people that are allegedly all about dividing people up by demographics and looking to right inequalities never bother to break down criminal justice by gender and do something about that?\n\nAnd on the occasions that they do do something regarding criminal justice and gender it's completely backward of what the stats would suggest leads toward \"equity\".  For example, moves in the UK to avoid imprisoning specifically women is not a move towards equity from a system that already imprisons men longer than women."}

When I was late teens early 20s I would just focus on what I feel, but with time I learned to put woman's pleasure first. First few times I explore what they like where they like to be touched etc. because everyone's different almost all women I've been with, like it when I show genuine interest in making them enjoy a priority.

His responsibility as a man was to ensure she felt safe, comfortable, and respected. \n\nNot replaceable, and a living fleshlight for him to dip his meat into whenever he gets a chubby. \n\nI dunno what signs you saw that said she's horny but \"hey could you come back and pick me up, and give me a place to stay?

Those are my instincts, and always have been. The part that is fucked up doesn't hurt anyone but me. I can promise you I will work on it, as I have been last 6 years with enormous progress.\n\nI also love to smell my farts, but I'm disgusted with farts of other people. 0icking nosenose is one of my favorite things. Sometimes I will hold boogers for the whole day, so I can pick it like a miner."}
{"text":"Well that sounds like a personal problem."}
{"text":"Or maybe, just maybe, you're in an echo chamber. I don't give a damn how many people feel bad for touching their pee pee, I don't. You're literally no better than a Christian trying to force your beliefs onto everyone around you. Just because you feel a certain way, and you find others who feel the same, does not make you better or special. We're all different, so maybe stop being so sanctimonious."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why you're so mad. I just told you to read 2 amazing books. We don't learn about science by ourselves, we have to read from the people who really know it, and in case we wanna become experts too (even though never as good as them since they're the best in the world) we have to study it, like in an university.\nI'm not trying to be nice, I'm being normal. Clearly you got some serious problems right now, so I hope everything in your life goes as you wish"}
{"text":"listen, you might be right, I know a single thing about the thing you're arguing about, but do you seriously think that the way to validate you're point and make people believe what you say is by saying this to a person?;  \n\n&gt; degenerative piece of shit-  arrogant piece of vile shit -  you've proven yourself to me be nothing than a piece of shit I can't stand -  The world would be a lot better off if you'd just shut the fuck up- I can't take anymore of your pretentious bullshit"}

{"text":"I used to be so addicted to porn in the past, but I ended up watching so much that my standards rose to a level that few videos meet. I now appreciate the story and details of images and videos and not the content itself. Watching too much porn cured my porn addiction lol. I\u2019m on day 23 right now."}

{"text":"So is arguing on Reddit! You are wasting so much goddamn time, which is ironic. Are you getting a fucking payment for this? You said you don't take chances with small things. This makes no fucking sense. You're probably wasted half an hour thinking of replies, as opposed to 10 minutes of masturbation. All you can do is throw the word asshole left and right like it means something to me."}
{"text":"I guess you can debate this if you'te talking about non-porn masturbation. If its with porn, I 100% believe that it negatively affects your brain as well as body."}
{"text":"Not true, too much masturbation can cause serious damage! A friend of mine had to go to the doctor because of this and got the confirmation that it can be really harmful because it puts stress on your body and too much can cause heart damage and even lead to death."}

{"text":"Nah I feel the same. Think it's best to ignore it, let's spend the day doing something that doesn't piss us off. People will see what they want to see anyway.\n\nIt looks like the guy in the post has other problems and he tried to only use NoFap to resolve them. I mean look at the top upvoted comment in there. \n\nI don't mean to sound like a buzzkill but is that really what people find funny? \"Went from beating himself up to beating himself off\". That's exactly what the average unproductive, 0 life goals, 0 reflection, 0 self improvement, social media slave finds funny. Oh wait that's the average person... I am not saying to be a hustle bunny and make everything productive in your life - that's OTT and a recipe for disaster."}

{"text":"Don't you see how being rude isn't conducive to convincing someone? It makes them defensive.   \n   \nYou won't consider my points, but instead deliberately misinterpret everything I say.   \nThat's not how you win an actual argument.    \nThat's how you stay stupid.    \n   \nIs that not a clear enough point?   \nYou truck yourself into thinking you actually fair, but you're far from it.  \nPhilosophy was my major, and in all the arguments that I've read over those five years-- I've never heard anyone be as unfair as you are.   \nThat's the philosophical principle of charity. Please look it up.   \nIf you actually want to understand my argument, then look it up and describe to me why you do have it or why you don't need it.\nIf you don't do that then you're not actually being intellectual fair because you're not actually dealing with the issue.   \n   \nI have a conviction that you won't do it, because it doesn't fit with the character that I've seen in you. I doubt you are actually reading this text before responding.   \nI guess we'll see if you prove my conceptions wrong. If you don't and do exactly what I'm saying you will, then you've proved yourself wrong.   \nI'm surprised it's so complicated for you.   \nThis whole message I'm responding to you.   \nI don't understand."}

{"text":"I'm sorry about you're brother, but you are coming into a sub to laugh at people who are suffering from an addiction. Seems to me that you are the one who is deranged. Yes, heroin addiction and porn addiction are diffrent, but that doesn't give you the right to demish someones struggles just because you don't go through or understand those struggles yourself."}
