Fascism is a purely constructive ideology predicated on a dictatorship of the people for the people. Generally, I'm centre-right on social issues and center-left on economics, and I am more of a trade protectionist and trade unionist than a Nazi. National Socialism is predicated upon a belief of a rigid system of racial dominance. Fascism is predicated upon the people working together to secure a homeland for themselves and a future for their children. Fascism is, by design, benevolent, as committing genocides is an anti-fascist action. Generally, fascists are just very much in favor of trade isolationism, closed borders, generous welfare programs for citizens, and public spending. National Socialism is in favor of genocide, expanding borders, militarism, expansionism, concentration of power in corporate bodies, and private spending. Sure fascists have done bad things, just like everyone else, but most of those things were either out of desperation or foreign influence.","category":0,"index":154}

Let me rephrase, do you think men should be able to override a womans decision on whether she wants to carry to term? No, you don't. Or at least you know it's bigoted and you wont say it.\n\nSo you came to the conclusion that \"if i don't get to decide what happens to a woman because she has a fetus that is argueably partially mine, i sure as hell am not gonna pay for it\" in your head that works, its common sense, it feels like an equivalency. But its not, its a face value similarity. This is due to two main reasons. #1: you do not nessacarily have the right to money the way she has reproductive rights. For example the gocernment can tax someone, but it cannot force them to abort a pregnancy. #2: now that the baby exists, it is yours. You have equal rights to it whether you want it or not and, you owe it whether you want it or not. Same goes for her. \n\nTo \"fix\" this would be to make child support optional. Create a legal system where women are financially tied  to children and men are not. One where men have the choice between giving their child the life it deserves and personal monetary gain. That is bad for women and even more so for children.","category":0,"index":653}

Not that it happens all the time, but normalizing moral depraved behaviors lead to a repetitive cycle in which their next morally depraved action is justified in their minds.\n\nPsychology 101.

He struck up a conversation with me on my way home from school and talked about bands. Gave him my MsM chat email thing or whatever it was 15 years ago to swap music. Thought it was a genuine friendship and even told the guy I was in highschool. He watched what stop I got off on.\n\nSo, we chat, turns out he's not in highschool, he's like 21. He asks if I have a boyfriend and then threatens to beat him up if he ever cheated. Kept asking to meet up. Skeeved me out but didn't know how to stop talking to him without being rude so I said I was busy helping with the family garage sale.\n\nDude went to every garage sale in the area he saw me get off the bus stop at. He found my house btw, but thankfully I wasn't home. He asked my grandpa if I lived there and he confirmed it not thinking about if this guy had good intentions or not.\n\nHe found also found out my kind rejection was a lie and started to get more aggressive. Again, I was 16 and completely taken back on how or why this guy insists I need a 'nice guy' like him to watch out for me and protect me from douchebags like my boyfriend. \n\nIn the end, I got my boyfriend, also in highschool, to threaten the guy who to back off. Because I know my ultra religious parents who already monitored everything I did would blame me and probably cut off the last remnants of my social life in highschool if they found out I was kind to a stranger.\n\nAfter that, my car kept getting egged and scratched up, tires punctured sporadically. Like, I've been harrassed. Asking for favours isn't harrassment.

{"text":"First - gas-lighting doesn't suit you. You're admitting that he's cringe worthy and then saying that he isn't? FDS principles make it pretty clear what a red flag is, and nearly every other statement this guy makes in relation to women is a red flag.\n\nSecond - coming and promoting a guy as HVM for 'staying with his wife when she was sick'... we've all seen posts of guys who 'stayed' with their wives while they were sick. If you weren't there, you don't know if he actually was of use.\n\nThird - the guy openly admitted to having a drug problem. And openly talks about his issues with 'emotions', yet gives people shit for being weak when he himself couldn't handle his own depression. Not exactly a HV quality.\n\nFourth - The fact that you somehow skipped or missed all of the interviews that he's done where he openly says women were happier in the 1950's as housewives serving the family... aka indentured servitude, is astounding to me, because he makes that claim, a LOT. He's also made this claim when he spoke to Jokko Wilink in an interview on his Podcast stating that there's a 'hierarchy' that needs to be respected for the sake of order... which ties into his affiliations with white supremacists and authoritarian organizations.\n\nEdit: Adding another point...\n\nTo anyone reading Mommajamma-204's responses, pay attention, this is either actually secretly a guy, or this is a the work of a woman who is actually not there to support other women. The tactful manipulation to 'find the facts' but actually ignore the facts that are there to make a case are astounding. Their comments are actually littered with red-flags. They admit that he says cringe-worthy stuff, but still support him? A basic FDS principle is if a guy says and repeatedly comments on something, like 1950's housewives were the happiest, that's total BS and we all know that here. Which is why we'openly promote having your own money, job, place to live, etc. is absolutely necessary so that you don't get trapped like our mother's and grandmother's did.\n\nTake those messages a lesson on what type of 'woman' supports the work of a man who thinks that you should be satisfied without a bank account, at home, as a stay at home mom, and that having a career isn't going to be enough for you.","category":0,"index":1636}

Hip continues to worsen over the years with doctors dismissing her as a drug seeker. No one was helping find\/fix the cause so she wanted the pain to stop. Fast forward to last year. Suddenly she\u2019s so sick she can\u2019t speak.  Literally like overnight. Take her to hospital, they decide they need to open her up to see what\u2019s going on. They immediately see her entire body is so riddled with cancer, there is nothing to be done. She died 3 days later in agony. All because when her hip hurt, they didn\u2019t want to look for why.

{"text":"I don't date currently, I prefer to live alone now because it gives me freedoms that women can't.  I follow exactly their advices if a woman doesnt give value to your life, you don't need one. I would want to make kids one day and have a stable family but I just haven't found a normal woman for that, the ones I knew have all took the SJW route, and I am not interested in meeting new women in the current climate. I'm not ugly, I'm not fat, nor short, nor have a small penis. I`m above average in terms of sexual market value and could easily seduce at least 6 out of 10 women IRL at the bare minimum, but I just choose not to. You know you don't have to be controlled by a woman, been there done that, and it's not good. I like doing my own stuff and I feel good as things are today. I just dont feel like your average woman can bring anything positive in my life. I had my fair share of abusive girlfriends who just used me and cheated on me, and all that nagging and whining, I just dont need any of that. Being with a woman is like 2-3 weeks of extasy and fun but it slowly goes downhill after that after she starts nagging you and controlling you, and you always have to compromise on stuff you like to do, that is just so much not worth it. I like to play video games for hours for example, I like to go jogging on long walks alone because I like being alone. And then I always have to spend time with her or explain myself to her, as if I were under interrogation. You just don't know how much freedom you lose once you get into a relationship. Sure you can find a woman that understands you but those are very rare, and so far only mythological in my experience, it only exists in TV, because every IRL woman that is somewhat past teenage stupidity (like 20-25 category) already has tons of expectations and already brings her ideology into the relationship. Romance and mutual respect only exists in 19th century novels, today IRL, society is really fucked up and you have to lower your expectations heavily. And I just feel like my hobbies and habits are worth more than a low expectation woman at this point.","category":0,"index":2391}

This is why he got the Evangelicals in his base so quickly and thoroughly.  Their religion was absolutely responsible for their support of his fascism.  Evangelical also made up the bulk of the fanatic followers of Adolf Hitler for the same reasons.  It's history rhyming because of religion.\n\nIf someone identifies as Muslim while being what is by and large in western society recognized as a decent person, great.  But by doing so they are choosing which aspects of Islam to adhere to and which to ignore.  As such they are believing that everything about Islam is true except for those bits that they cannot follow and still be decent people.  They still adhere to beliefs they would not otherwise have, and their thoughts and behavior influenced accordingly.  They will have that tendency to believe without proof, and perpetuate their religion, even if they don't follow the whole thing.\n\nThe same applies to any given religion.  That's the problem that causes archaic ideas to have hold in an otherwise decent and rational society.  It's a huge cause of why people still mutilate, murder, and make war on each other, restrict people from having fulfilling lives, and oppose scientific developments that improve people's live and understanding of their world.","category":0,"index":2478}

That is exactly what body autonomy means, I have the choice to do it or not to do it. You act as an independent free agent and get to choose for yourself whether or not to participate. Your body is only your own, and **each individual should be able to decide how to use their own bodies**.\n\nTo frame this differently, I am glad that we have wood &amp; paper products. The fact that I won\u2019t go cut down trees myself doesn\u2019t make me a hypocrite. \n\nThe argument that truly safe sex doesn\u2019t exist is disingenuous because truly safe work *in general* doesn\u2019t exist. Workers accept a certain level of risk, and govt bodies exist to make that risk as low as possible. There\u2019s no reason sex work should be any different. Whether the risk is losing a limb to industrial work, respiratory illness from healthcare, or sexually transmitted disease from sex work is irrelevant. All of them are a risk that individuals choose when they engage in that career. \n\nProstitution *as it exists now* is massively exploitative and harmful *because it subverts law*. What I am advocating for\u2014and what I\u2019ve been describing the entire time\u2014is regulated, protected sex work. \n\nI\u2019m finished engaging in this because at every stage I\u2019ve presented basic arguments about individual freedoms and been met with personal, aggressive attacks that literally don\u2019t address the basic point I\u2019ve stated in every single comment. **An individual has the fundamental right to choose how to use their own body.

This law will allow them to work until 9:30PM which means in half an hour from the time they clock out it's 10PM. For context: my kids have to get up at 5:30AM to get to school on time. That doesn't leave much time for eating dinner or taking a shower, let alone doing homework or studying.\n\nMy argument is that this will hurt precisely the children who are already the most vulnerable: the *poor*. \n\nWe have undercut the social safety net to the point that a lot of people will make the decision that it's better to have more money now - even at the expense of hurting their ability to get a better education and *maybe* go on to do better things later.\n\nWhat I didn't do is call you names or insult your intelligence. \n\nBut, you bring up a good point: why did you decide to come on an anti-work sub since you seem to be advocating for the good 'ole bootstraps argument? I'm not trying to be sarcastic or an asshole: I'm legitimately curious.

We all know that society has decided that a clump of cells isn't a person.\n\nThat's an arbitrary decision we've made. At what point a clump of cells gains personhood and becomes an autonomous person with rights is not a question science can answer. We're ALL clumps of cells.\n\nNow, that argument has lots of holes, such as IVF. IVF fertilizes thousands of eggs in the hopes that one will implant. Does each of these zygotes now have personhood? Is that now mass murder?\n\n\nThe above was salient point made by a deleted comment. \n\n\nProtestant American pro-lifers are not that intelligent and are way too pro-bourgeous to think about ivf. \n\n Catholics ones are opposed. \n\nSecular pro-lifers, it depends on their reasoning to be against abortion. So more a mixed bag. \n\nPersonally, ivf is ethically dubious even without the abortion problem thrown into it.

Is it that you associate male sexuality, generally speaking, with misogyny, like in a PIV-is-violence Dworkin sense? Is it male sexual desire for women that you find problematic and hateful? Let's be clear: he's saying \"treat women as people\" was useless as dating advice. That by itself, seems abundantly self-evident, since it's not even dating advice in the first place - it's like telling someone looking for career advice that the key is just to treat prospective employers as people, and jobs will materialize for you. This is not even *bad* career advice. It's not career advice whatsoever. The OP then says \"treat women as people *that you want to have sex with*\" was the strategy that worked for him. What aspect of this successful strategy is a problem for you? I have to imagine that you think treating someone you're interested in dating as someone you're interested in dating is the problematic part, but that's obviously ridiculous, right?

She also was married off super young and had kids super young because Mexican American woman born in the 40s, so I definitely feel that she sees what she missed out on and wanted more for her family. I came out to her terrified and it was never an issue, in fact she and my partner have a relationship outside of me. She's still incredibly involved with the church, sans covid, but has never been THAT Catholic. She's definitely on a more Jesuit path and loves Pope Francis.","category":0,"index":3124}

They all do it. A lot. One major reason is because while not *all* feminist theory and doctrine is outright hateful, (although plenty is) just about ALL feminist ideas facilitate the patterns of thought that LEAD to hate. For example: We live in a patriarchy - men are privileged - women are disadvantaged relative to men at best, subjugated and oppressed at worst - Men facilitate and control this system - men are my oppressors. Hatred or at least distaste of men is *the logical conclusion to this train of thought*. Looking at it objectively, how could you not begin to hate someone who is oppressing you? Actually I would assert that hating someone who is playing an active role in your oppression is a perfectly logical and reasonable thing to do! The problem is that it's...

Why does crowder have to debate Sam seder. He could think he's bad faith and not want to engage with him or signal boost him or add legitimacy by debating him.\n\nTheres no evidence of him wanting Ethan to engage in bad faith by lieing and bringing on someone else to debate for him. He wanted to debate Ethan. I'd assume he watched Seders streams because he knew Ethan might act in bad faith like this and he was right.\n\nWas AOC ducking a debate vs Shapiro cause she was scared to?\n\n\nNope crowder acted fine no one acts unconditionally civil when the other person isn't civil. Up until he found out Ethan was bad faith he was nice then upon discovering Ethan was a bad faith actor he wasn't nice anymore and why should he be? Nope Ethan just looks like a shithead who needs Sam to explain why he believes anything despite being a grown adult im suprised anyone would believe anything he says after this. He can cry racism or any leftist opinion, whatever but we know now thats just Sam reaching his hand up Ethans ass and controlling him like a muppet.\nCrowder acted reasonable no reason to debate a dishonest actor like Ethan or Sam.","category":0,"index":3668}

He was right about [Gallo](https:\/\/archive.nytimes.com\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage-9F0CEFDA103DF932A05751C1A964958260.html) and Fauci being frauds too.\n\n**\u201cGuys like Fauci get up there and start talking, you know, and he doesn\u2019t know anything about anything. And I\u2019d say that to his face. Nothing.\u201d**\n\n\u201cTony **Fauci does not mind going on television**, in front of the people that pay his salary, and **lie directly into the camera.\u201d**\n-Kary Mullis\nhttps:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=5aISPlTLbJo\n\n**\u201dPeople keep asking me, \u2018You mean you don\u2019t believe that HIV causes AIDS?\u2019 And I say, \u2019Whether I believe it or not is irrelevant! I have no scientific evidence for it!\u2019** I might believe in God, and He could have told me in a dream that HIV causes AIDS. But I wouldn\u2019t stand up in front of scientists and say, \u2018I believe HIV causes AIDS because God told me.\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018I have papers here in hand and experiments that have been done that can be demonstrated to others.\u2019 It\u2019s not what somebody believes, it\u2019s experimental proof that counts. And **neither Montagnier, Gallo, nor anyone else had published papers describing experiments which led to the conclusion that HIV probably caused AIDS.\u201d**\n\nMullis even had the opportunity do ask **Montagnier** personally about a reference proving that HIV causes AIDS. But he couldn\u2019t name one. \u201cIt was damned irritating,\u201c as **Mullis reported. \u201cIf Montagnier didn\u2019t know the answer, who the hell did?\u201c**\n\n[Anthony Fauci: 40 Years of Lies From AZT to Remdesivir](https:\/\/off-guardian.org\/2020\/10\/27\/anthony-fauci-40-years-of-lies-from-azt-to-remdesivir\/)\n\n**Mullis asks Dr. Luc Montagnier for a reference stating \u2018HIV is the probable cause of AIDS.\u2019**\n\n\u201cSo, I didn\u2019t get any more out of him, **he (Montagnier) walked away after that. And the people standing around, by the way who were his colleagues there, looked at him thinking like he should come up with a better answer than that but he couldn\u2019t and he just turned around and walked away.** I really thought he\u2019d have an answer.  I really did! I mean, that was my last... I was right at the edge of my faith in the system... but I thought Montagnier will know why he thinks HIV causes it and he will tell me, \u2018it\u2019s because of this study,\u2019 you know? But he didn\u2019t have that.  **None of those guys have that and that\u2019s why they\u2019re so weird, you know?** That\u2019s why they don\u2019t want to say... they don\u2019t want people like me walking up and asking those kinds of questions and they\u2019re willing to go to great lengths to prevent that. They\u2019re out on a limb.  I wouldn\u2019t want to be there with them.\u201d\n-Kary Mullis\nhttps:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=W0XpMYMX0CM\n\n\u201cWhat ABC needs to do,\u201d says Mullis, \u201cis talk to Fauci and [Dr. Robert] Gallo [one of the discoverers of HIV] and show that they\u2019re assholes, which I could do in ten minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to him on his 1992 Spin interview, **\u201dPCR made it easier to see that certain people are infected with HIV and some of those people came down with symptoms of AIDS. But that doesn\u2019t begin even to answer the question, \u2018Does HIV cause it?\u2019\u201d**\n\n\u201cMullis challenged the popular wisdom that the disease-causing mechanisms of HIV are simply too \u201cmysterious\u201d to comprehend. **\u201dThe mystery of that damn virus,\u201d he said at the time, \u201chas been generated by the $2 billion a year they spend on it. You take any other virus, and you spend $2 billion, and you can make up some great mysteries about it too.\u201d**\nhttps:\/\/uncoverdc.com\/2020\/04\/07\/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus\/)\n\n\n\u201cEverybody was looking at the blood of an AIDS patient and finding it crawling with some new organism and said, \u2018hey, this is this virus that we call HIV now.\u2019\u201d\n\n**\u201dAll kinds of diseases started coming into the AIDS family, faster than anyone should\u2019ve been comfortable with**, really.  To go from two or three to go to 30 in a few years was like **somebody should\u2019ve said, \u2018hey, there\u2019s something wrong here and it\u2019s got to be financial.\u2019 Things don\u2019t happen that fast in science!** You don\u2019t suddenly notice that one new organism is causing every problem.\u201d\n-Kary Mullis: HIV and AIDS\nhttps:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=rycOLjoPbeo","category":0,"index":4387}

Same goes for Palestinians. and same goes for every other population outside of eastern asia.\n\nPlus, original \"Palestinians\" were judeans, the romans renamed judea to palestina and forced the judeans to convert to roman religion or be expelled. the Palestinians of anceint times were those judeans that converted and stayed. But then the arab conquests of the levant started and hellenized judeans became arabized judeans and after 1300 of muslim rule, became arabs different to their original \"Palestinian origin\". \n\nAlso, this idea that you can't use the bible as a claim that jews own the holy land is very euro centric, because both muslims and jews fiercely believe in a literal bible (or quran or torah you know what i mean). Muslim clerics in arabia (and all over the arab world) admit that the kingdom of Jerusalem is the kingdom of the jews, not the muslims. it's in both the torah and the quran. also in the quran it states that the kingdom of god's chosen (jacob's sons\/jews) will reclaim Jerusalem.

{"text":"An analogy:  \n\nThink about Nazi Germany. In a society where Germans necessarily are the majority and make the laws, the Jews can absolutely be made targets\/minorities and discriminated against. It's simple: They make the rules, Jews don't. Nothing they can do about it.\n\nBut what happens when they move to Israel and become the majority in government? Do you think any Jewish legislating body in their right mind would make discriminatory law against Jews, or orchestrate a Holocaust?\n\nNo. It's self-explanatory. It's so simple and in your face.\n\nSo why is it hard for you to understand that a government made up of MEN would *never* EVER, EVER, EVER pass a single law that discriminated against men? It has never happened in history. Every single country is a refuge for men and a safeguard for men's rights. There isn't a single country where they're in danger of being made a minority. They can go anywhere.\n\nYou cannot be in power and also be a minority in the same society. Therefore, men are NOT oppressed. They are not minorities.\n\nWomen would need to be in power in government to pass Taliban-like laws but against men. Only then would we need \"Men's Right's\" activism.\n\nAnd it's really a shame that YOU are the one demonizing feminism, the true activism that's actually good. Because what you're saying is \"I literally don't believe women should have rights.\" Being against things that are good for women? That's misogynistic.\n\nI'm trying to imagine what you could possible disagree with about feminism, specifically. like, what. Do you agree women should have the right to vote, but draw the line at women being socially equal to men? Which part about female equality pisses you off? How do you think women should still be oppressed?","category":0,"index":4727}

{"text":"Maybe because its an exaggeration to say that every amazon warehouse does that and you rarely get the whole story. I work middle management in a non amazon warehouse and everything I've heard about amazon is not that different from the warehouse industry as a whole. \n\nSo here's the thing about how warehouses work. Theres a ton of moving pieces, and everybody has a role to play in making sure the trucks get loaded on time. The people in question are most likely \"pickers.\" Pickers are given a standard amount of pieces they need to pick in a set time. This is their \"rate\" and rates are usually set by an outside company in order to be fair to the workers. The rate is based on what an average worker is capable of picking in a night.\n\n About 1\/3 to 1\/2 of the people that come through a warehouse are going to be physically or mentally incapable of hitting this \"rate\". That's when we start to question if you think the job is right for you. Its perfectly ok if its not, but we aren't going to keep you on if you aren't able to do your fair share of work. Its not fair to the other pickers. Its not charity work. Part of the pickers toolset is a hands-free headset that tells them exactly what items to pick and where they're at. It tracks idle time and performances. So if you're taking an extra break... we know. Now most people that are hitting their rate, we don't really care. But if you're at like 90% of you're rate... we're going to look for where the idle time is. We want you to succeed... it's expensive to hire and train someone. This is where \"bathroom breaks\" come into play. If you're on the floor fucking off, a supervisor will encourage you to get moving. You can't use your phone because you're operating equipment and its an osha violation. But if you go in the bathroom, its free game. So people hide in the bathroom for 20+ minutes at a time and play on their phone on company time. If this is happening once an hour, then ya, you're gonna get written up for taking too many bathroom breaks. \n\nNobody is asking them to piss in bottles. Some guys that are physically incapable of making their rate but really need the job might feel like they need to piss in bottles to make their performance, but if thats the case, the job isn't for them. Nothing wrong with that. I assure you, if any floor lead in any warehouse anywhere catches you pissing in a bottle you'll be suspended. That is 100% not the desired outcome.","category":0,"index":4748}

You said science doesn't agree with me. I said false and elaborated on why. People are born male or female, being queer is a choice after that, usually coming from mental illness, brainwashed, or possesion. Being a choice, it is not a civil issue in supporting sodomy, but moral one.\n\nGender and sex (adjective meaning) is the same thing. Gender being a mental start of being is another word redefine.\n\nPeople are born the sex they are for the entirety of their life. Sexual orientation is a choice. Only liers say that people can be born gay.\n\n&gt;Okay then stop trying to make your esoteric rules into laws\n\nWhat kind of person thinks anti abortion laws are esoteric?\n\n P.s. christian principles are very simple and straight forward.

Also we aren't the only ones who invaded and had wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Canada, Australia and New Zealand as well. Canada still hasn't given back plenty land to the natives and the land they do give back they use and sell without the natives rights. Canada also has a history of racism towards natives i.e starlight tours, Indian act. Australia has had similar problems. \n\nEvery country is messed up and does messed up shit that shouldn't happen, but targeting Americans specifically for it isn't right.

(the glitch relied on a specific wormhole type and class, so it could only be used in a few systems, including their home)\n\n Eventually a different group attacked them, and although they failed they managed to get a few kills, revealing the fits of the defenders and noticing that their ranges were weird. They managed to reverse engineere the glitch and figure out its cause (tracking disruption strong enough to set a ship's weapon tracking negative), and reported it to the developer.

The refusal to submit to gender identity ideology and its mantra that 'gender identity' determines wo\/manhood does in no way imply \"you refuse to see trans people as people\". Your entire tirade is full of ad hominem and petty insults. \n\n\"Lived experience\" - Why don't you consider the lived experience of girls and women who are constantly told they have to validate males? That their 'lived experience' as females is irrelevant, not just that, if they talk about it is 'transphobic'. You are such a little hypocrite.\n\nBut moreover - who cares about 'lived experience'? For one every experience is lived, you think by adding lived it gives more credit to this absurd notion? \n\n\"Leave the bubble\", oh the irony in that. The only one being a dick here is you, harassing someone for not submitting to your insane ideology.","category":0,"index":5199}

{"text":" Title: The Great Race Swap Debate: Why Changing Character Races is a Problem\n\nHey fellow Redditors,\n\nI've been seeing a lot of controversy online lately about race-swapping characters in movies and TV shows. Some people are outraged, while others are all for it. As someone who's passionate about comics and video games, I wanted to share my thoughts on the matter.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about why people are upset. It's not just about being offended by the change; it's about the fact that these characters have a specific cultural and historical context that's being disregarded. For example, Heimdall is a Norse god with a specific backstory and personality. Changing his race completely undermines that context and reduces him to a mere caricature.\n\nNow, I know some people will argue that it's important to represent diverse perspectives and experiences in media. And I agree, that's important. But here's the thing: there are already plenty of diverse characters in comics and video games that don't need their races changed. Why not","category":1,"index":7317}

That's...interesting. I'm not sure if you're trying to confuse me or if you genuinely believe that. Either way, it's not accurate to say that fascism is inherently right-wing. Fascism is a political ideology that is characterized by authoritarianism, nationalism, and suppression of political opposition. It can be found in various political spectrums, including the far right, but it's not exclusive to one side.\n\nAnd, btw, I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but insulting people and calling them ignorant is not a great way to start a conversation or prove a point. It's actually a pretty basic tactic used by people who can't handle disagreements in a civil manner.

{"text":" Wow, thanks for sharing your thoughts on this! It's definitely a complex and controversial topic. While I can't agree with you on everything, I do think it's important to have a nuanced discussion about the intersection of double jeopardy laws and murder\/manslaughter charges.\n\nFirst of all, it's worth noting that double jeopardy laws are in place to protect individuals from being unfairly prosecuted multiple times for the same crime. The idea is that once a person has been acquitted or convicted of a crime, they should be unable to be tried again for that same crime. This is a fundamental principle of justice and fairness, and it's important to ensure that individuals are not subjected to repeated punishment for the same offense.\n\nHowever, as you pointed out, the combination of double jeopardy laws and murder\/manslaughter charges can lead to some absurd results.
